AdvNeelofar February 21, 2019 Moved to help by disturbing videos Nasir Khuehami, spokesperson Jammu and Kashmir Students Organisation, said that without the help of Khalsa Aid, the safety and security of Kashmiri students on their way home would have been compromised. Khalsa Aid got in touch with us on Twitter and offered help. They arranged buses for distressed Kashmiri students from Dehradun and Ambala. Otherwise, it would have been immensely difficult to ensure safety and survival of Kashmiris, he said. Khalsa Aid, an international organisation based in the United Kingdom, is known for its humanitarian work during natural disasters, wars and other calamities. Gurpreet Singh, head of group in India, said they decided to offer help to distressed Kashmiris after coming across disturbing videos of harassment and calls for help from Kashmiris. We were able to evacuate more than 300 Kashmiri students safely to Chandigarh and then to Jammu. We could have sent them to Kashmir directly but there were some problems with coordination. Most of the distressed students we helped were studying in Dehradun and Haryana, said Singh. They were helped by other local Sikh organisations and gurudwara committees. Local gurudwaras were thrown open for Kashmiri students and we were able to give them shelter and food, said Singh, who led a group 30 volunteers for the task. Need to show gratitude The gesture evoked a warm response in Kashmir. Imtiyaz Ahmad Wani, a general surgeon, was among the first to offer gratitude to the Sikh community. Wani has offered free medical consultations to Sikh patients in Srinagar for a year. As a Kashmiri Muslim, I am highly thankful to our Sikh brethren for what they did to ensure safety of Kashmiris. This is my way of showing gratitude to them, said Wani. Till Thursday morning, Wani had not received any calls for free consultation. But he is hopeful. I can travel to anywhere to fulfil my promise. I won t be charging any fee from them at all, Wani, who is posted in Baramulla in North Kashmir. Thirty year old Mudasir Ahmad of Anantnag district, a mechanic, has decided to waive labour charges for washing or repairing vehicles owned by Sikh customers. If someone takes a single step of love towards you, we should reciprocate with two. That s what humanity is. By this I want Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs to come together to strengthen the sense of brotherhood among us, he said. On Thursday afternoon, he said, he had received half a dozen calls from Sikh customers inquiring about the discount. The local Kashmiri press expressed its gratitude as well. Kashmir s leading English daily, Greater Kashmir, carried a cartoon of a turban wearing man in a boat holding out a hand to a drowning Kashmiri man. I was touched by their gesture, said Suhail Naqshbandi, the cartoonist. I kept hearing about Khalsa Aid sometime back, when they were working in Syria and other places. Honestly speaking, they have got nothing to do with Kashmir but still they took it upon themselves to offer help. That s why I thought of showing them my version of gratitude. On Wednesday, a group of non local traders and labourers in Srinagar also held protest against attacks on Kashmiris. We are secular For Sikh leaders in Kashmir, the warmth pouring in was yet another example of communal harmony and brotherhood in the Valley. It s a great gesture but it s not for the first time. During floods of 2014, it was our Kashmiri brothers who put us in mosques and provided us with food. So, a gesture like this is not rare in Kashmir, said Jagmohan Singh Raina, chairman of the All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee. Whenever there s a crisis, Kashmiri Muslims distribute food and other items to minorities first. Our secularism is undisputed. People may say anything but the brotherhood and love in our Kashmir is nowhere else. Khalsa Aid representatives also acknowledged the gestures of local Kashmiris. We didn t carry out our work to expect any benefits. Serving humanity is our philosophy. But the way Kashmiri Muslims have reacted, it will send a good message of brotherhood and love, said Gurpreet Singh.\n",

Talks are doing rounds that the party state unity chief Basant Panda is keen to contest from Kalahandi. Similarly, the name of Pradipta Nayak and Arka Keshari Deo are also in the race. While Jayram Pangi is among one of the favourites for the Koraput Lok Sabha seat, the party is in quandary over candidates for Bargarh and Kandhamal.

Some disgruntled workers also ransacked office of the party unit in Laxmipur opposing the candidature of Kumuda Saunta today.\n",
      "The Kerala Police said that they had either injured or killed a suspected Maoist in a gun battle that broke out between the armed group and law enforcers in a forested locality near Vythiri in Wayanad district late Wednesday. They said no officer had been injured in the firefight, which was continuing late into the night. Officers said around 10 Maoists, armed with automatic weapons possibly AK 47s, were holding the high ground. A squad of police commandos have pinned them down in a bid to encircle the group and force their surrender. The police said their commandos encountered heavy fire from automatic weapons. They fanned out in battle order, established a skirmish line and returned fire in equal measure. Senior officers have ordered the commandos to proceed with caution so as to not get ambushed by booby traps laid by the retreating Maoists. An officer said the Thunderbolts had given hot pursuit to the Maoists who had arrived at a local resort to demand cash and provision. The armed group had withdrawn into the forest from where they had appeared without warning. The Maoists reportedly fired at the pursuing special forces, who retaliated with automatic fire, aggravating the situation. The Thunderbolts were kitted out with night vision equipment, and GPS and the senior officers were tracking their geospatial position and also the encounter as it unfolded in the dense forests with thick undergrowth.

The exchange of fire took place around 9.30 p.m. near the resort.\n",

      "NEW DELHI The centre has found nothing amiss in Kashmiri separatist raising provocative anti India slogans during their march to the UN office in Srinagar on Monday. In fact, Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta hailed the peaceful protest march, meant to demand UN intervention to facilitate Kashmiris right to self determination, saying that there was no reason to disallow the march that has been taken out time and again. Our only concern was to ensure that there is no violence or loss of life or property...the necessary deployment of forces was done and the march passed off peacefully, he told a press conference here on Monday afternoon. Mr Guptas smug reaction at the forces having done a good job came even as reports from Srinagar spoke of demonstrators chanting slogans like Down with India and The Lashker has come...It is your death, India Thousands of police and paramilitary forces in riot gear guarded the streets during the march, but no violence was reported. In the national Capital, Mr Gupta confirmed that every possible action of the government is to ensure that there is no violence...there is no compromise on that. Earlier, the separatist hoisting of Pakistani flag at Lal Chowk in Srinagar on Independence Day had come in for sharp criticism. When asked how this could be allowed, Mr Gupta clarified that we have ways to deal with such things....action is taken.... but we have also to ensure that it involves minimum use of force and that there is no loss of life. The governments attitude can be gauged as nothing short of magnanimous considering that the protesters in Srinagar raised slogans like Lashkar has arrived...It is your death, India...Lashkar has come. Masarat Aalam, a prominent separatist, was quoted by the agencies as saying that the Kashmiri leaders would deliver a petition to the UN office in Srinagar alleging human rights violations and requesting the international bodys intervention. This is a march for our freedom, protester Sajid Maqbool said as thousands chanted the name of Lashkar e Taiba, the leading Pakistan based terrorists outfit that has carried out several powerful bomb blasts in the hinterland. Organisers claimed that the protest on Monday was the largest since unrest sharply escalated two months ago. At least 34 people have been killed in Kashmir following the tensions created by separatist propaganda about an alleged economic blockade by the Amarnath land row agitators. The Centre has clarified time and again, the latest instance being on Monday, that the economic blockade is a myth spread by the separatist forces and goods and traffic have been moving freely between Jammu and Srinagar, barring a few disruptions for barely 3 days. At least 1,030 trucks have moved on the Jammu Srinagar highway from either side on August 17 and 18, Mr Gupta confirmed on Monday. Meanwhile, in Jammu, protesters supporting restoration of land to Amarnath shrine board on Monday defied a ban on public gatherings to assemble in large groups to court arrest. One of the organisers, Suchet Singh, said such gatherings would go on for three days and that more than 100,000 people were expected to take part.\n",

The two countries quickly traded airstrikes. Online, there was another battle.

      "Listen to this story Srinagar, Mar 21 Various trade bodies on Thursday stage a protest against what they termed as killing of a civilian Rizwan Pandith of Awantipora on Tuesday in police custody. Carrying placards and raising slogans, the traders held a joint protest at Srinagar s Jamia Masjid, demanding the killing spree in the Valley be stopped. Killing of innocent civilian who was a private school principal is a deep rooted conspiracy and a planned genocide of people of Kashmir, the traders said. Terming the incident as highly unfortunate, Sajad Gul, spokesman of the trade bodies said, We urge the Indian civil society and international bodies such as Amnesty International to come forward and play its role. If this attitude of the Central government continues there will be serious consequences. How can they kill any innocent without any justification Civilians continue to get killed and get maimed at the will of trigger happy forces as it is the worst form of human rights abuses and violations in Kashmir, Gul said. He said because of the unbridled powers given to the forces and the lack of accountability, every day innocent civilians are brutally killed, which is condemnable in all forms. Pertinently, JRL had appealed all segments of society including traders, lawyers, bar association, civil society and others to protest against the custodial killing and assaults on Kashmiris . Those participated in the protest include KEA, KTMF, KCCI, KTMF R , FCIK, Beopar Mandal S R Gunj and other trader bodies.\n",
      "The Bharatiya Janata Party BJP will never sever its ideological ties with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS . But ever since the Narendra Modi government assumed office in 2014, the party has been rapidly metamorphosing into an entity no longer as dependent on the RSS network as it once was, or, indeed, as mindful of the latter s leadership. The rapid expansion of the BJP organisation on the ground, the construction of modern party offices equipped with the latest communication tools, and a more centralised way of functioning with all party office bearers answerable to party president Amit Shah and Mr. Modi has reduced the importance of the RSS in the BJP s scheme of things. For the Modi Shah duo that leads the BJP, this slight shift in balance is important because the desire to wield absolute power by winning as many elections as possible takes precedence over all else, whether it is the stated goal of development or the unstated one of the spread of Hindutva. Targeting fence sitters Earlier this week, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat turned the spotlight on the 93 year old organisation he heads, at a three day conclave in New Delhi. Facing possibly the most vigorous and sharp attack in its history from the Congress, under president Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Bhagwat attempted a major image makeover for the RSS, describing it as one committed to creating an inclusive society of which Muslims and other minorities are an indivisible part. He talked of unity in diversity a long standing Congress slogan , acknowledged the Congress s stellar role in the freedom struggle, and said he didn t believe in a Congress mukt Bharat though that has been the rallying cry of top BJP leaders . Flagging the spate of lynchings, he said no one had the right to take the law in their own hands even though cow protection is an imperative. If the RSS chief s effort was to ensure that Hindu centrists, disturbed by attacks on the vulnerable, did not desert the BJP for the Congress, the apparent departure from the Golwalkar Hedgewar hard line threw the RSS faithful into a state of confusion. Also Read Trust vote sets the tone for 2019 poll For RSS cadres, the message was clear they must take their cue from the RSS chief who was trying to increase his organisation s acceptability among Hindu fence sitters. That Mr. Bhagwat s speeches were motivated by political expediency rather than a change of heart was apparent. At the recent World Hindu Congress in Chicago, he had given a rallying cry for Hindu unity, and called its opponents dogs . The RSS believes in the power of the collective, and is therefore uncomfortable with the cult status that Mr. Modi has acquired. It is also unhappy with the Modi Shah duo s strategy of seeking to isolate dominant Hindu castes to consolidate the rest against them in Haryana, the BJP successfully united non Jats against Jats in Uttar Pradesh, non Yadavs against Yadavs in Gujarat, non Patels against Patels. Now in Maharashtra, there appears to be an effort to bring together non Marathas against Marathas. The BJP has adopted these tactics as its apex leadership has realised the limitations of working towards Hindu consolidation as its only electoral plan. The RSS, however, sees this as hampering Hindu unity, which has been its only goal since its founding in 1925. Also Read BJP looks to send its political message for 2019 polls Nevertheless, the stakes for the RSS are just too high for it to work against the party that is its only ticket to achieving its ultimate goal of establishing a Hindu Rashtra in India, something the current BJP leadership is also happy to promote. Indeed, at the RSS conclave, Mr. Bhagwat urged his audience largely RSS supporters not to tap the NOTA button, but cast their votes, by implication, for the BJP. A difficult election The BJP leadership knows it will not be as easy a ride as it was in 2014. At the BJP National Executive earlier this month, Mr. Modi tried a new tack For 31 years we are in power in Gujarat. We have been able to do that because we are not greedy for power. We don t seek power as an instrument of sitting on the chair, rather we seek power to work for the people. He presented this as a contrast to the Opposition s politics. Also Read Will it be BJP versus the rest in 2019 For a government that claims success on all fronts, turning the spotlight on the Opposition may seem surprising. But the BJP knows a second term in power will depend largely on its ability to train the attention of voters on the contradictions in the Opposition, rather than on its own mixed record in office including the Rafale controversy and discontent over rising fuel prices and the rumblings within its ranks for instance, upper caste rage against the government for having restored the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act to its original form. The BJP is also not taking lightly the Opposition s successes in by elections in U.P. and Bihar, where parties earlier antagonistic to each other joined forces to defeat the BJP, thus projecting a template for 2019. Mr. Modi, of course, remains the larger than life figure who can be pitted successfully against the lesser mortals of the Opposition, and he is the BJP s best bet to paper over the grievances, dissatisfactions and anger accumulated over the last four years. If the BJP retains the majority it won in the Lok Sabha in 2014, the road will be clear for Mr. Modi. But there is no saying what would happen if does not will the allies and the RSS then have a say in deciding the next Prime Minister s name Smita Gupta is Senior Fellow, The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy\n",

      "In a major embarrassment to the Congress, Sujay, the son of the leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, is likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP on Tuesday. Sujay had made his intention to contest the Ahmednagar constituency, his home turf, clear nearly two months ago, but the seat was in the quota of ally Nationalist Congress Party NCP . The NCP refused to swap this seat with the Congress despite requests made to the party chief, Sharad Pawar. So far, there has been no formal comment from the Vikhe Patils, but the BJP has announced this decision. With Sujay set to quit Congress, there is speculation in political circles that his father and mother, Shalini Vikhe Patil, also party district president, may quit the party ahead of the Assembly polls. The decision is said to have been taken even as Congress tried its best to stop Sujay from joining BJP, including making a last ditch attempt by All India Congress Committee AICC Maharashtra in charge Mallikarjun Kharge and other senior leaders to intercede with NCP on Monday. This was done even as Vikhe Patil met Congress president Rahul Gandhi and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi late in Delhi. Sujay Vikhe Patil will join the BJP on Tuesday around 1pm. So far, formal decision on handing him the Ahmednagar Lok Sabha ticket has not been taken, but that s a given. Since we have a sitting MP from Ahmednagar, there is bound to be some discomfort over this move, but the Chief Minister and state president will handle this, said a state BJP minister. Sujay met BJP minister Girish Mahajn, considered to be a close aide of Fadnavis last week. The internal unease over importing a candidate from Congress was evident at the BJP party meeting in their Dadar office, when MP Dilip Gandhi s supporters shouted slogans in front of Fadnavis. NCP chief Pawar made the party s stance clear earlier in the afternoon at a press conference in Pune. He questioned the need for NCP to sacrifice a seat for Sujay, who had no contribution for the Congress NCP alliance. He said, The Ahmednagar seat has been with the NCP. We have two of the six sitting legislators in this Lok Sabha constituency, while Congress has none. There is a strong likelihood that we can win this seat. I don t think there will be much of a difference even if Sujay joins BJP. Pawar reminded the Congress that the seat had gone to NCP after the party candidate defeated Sujay s grandfather Balasaheb Vikhe Patil. It is being said that Pawar s refusal stems from enmity between him and the Vikhe Patils, but Congress leaders also suggested a way out of the logjam, of Sujay contesting on a NCP ticket, which had also been denied by the latter. Congress state president Ashok Chavan had worked out via media to let Sujay contest on a NCP, ticket but he refused to join the party. He said he would either contest as an independent or join the BJP, said a senior Congress leader. The enmity between Pawar and Balasaheb Vikhe Patil goes back to 1991 polls, when the latter had filed a petition against Yashwantrao Gadakh, Congress MP, and accused Pawar of corrupt electoral practices. Pawar had faced strictures from the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court in this case, but was later given a clean chit by the Supreme Court. Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil had made an emotional appeal to Sharad Pawar urging him to end the decade old feud as his father was no more. Pawarsaheb s enmity was with my father. He should leave it behind after the demise of my father, Radhakrishna had said. Earlier in the day, Chavan had said that Dr Sujay should wait patiently as party leaders were trying their best for the ticket. He was reacting on the reports of Sujay planning to join BJP.

Khalsa Aid got in touch with us on Twitter and offered help. They arranged buses for distressed Kashmiri students from Dehradun and Ambala. Otherwise, it would have been immensely difficult to ensure safety and survival of Kashmiris, he said. Khalsa Aid, an international organisation based in the United Kingdom, is known for its humanitarian work during natural disasters, wars and other calamities. Gurpreet Singh, head of group in India, said they decided to offer help to distressed Kashmiris after coming across disturbing videos of harassment and calls for help from Kashmiris. We were able to evacuate more than 300 Kashmiri students safely to Chandigarh and then to Jammu. We could have sent them to Kashmir directly but there were some problems with coordination. Most of the distressed students we helped were studying in Dehradun and Haryana, said Singh. They were helped by other local Sikh organisations and gurudwara committees. Local gurudwaras were thrown open for Kashmiri students and we were able to give them shelter and food, said Singh, who led a group 30 volunteers for the task. Need to show gratitude The gesture evoked a warm response in Kashmir. Imtiyaz Ahmad Wani, a general surgeon, was among the first to offer gratitude to the Sikh community. Wani has offered free medical consultations to Sikh patients in Srinagar for a year. As a Kashmiri Muslim, I am highly thankful to our Sikh brethren for what they did to ensure safety of Kashmiris. This is my way of showing gratitude to them, said Wani. Till Thursday morning, Wani had not received any calls for free consultation. But he is hopeful. I can travel to anywhere to fulfil my promise. I won t be charging any fee from them at all, Wani, who is posted in Baramulla in North Kashmir. Thirty year old Mudasir Ahmad of Anantnag district, a mechanic, has decided to waive labour charges for washing or repairing vehicles owned by Sikh customers. If someone takes a single step of love towards you, we should reciprocate with two. That s what humanity is. By this I want Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs to come together to strengthen the sense of brotherhood among us, he said. On Thursday afternoon, he said, he had received half a dozen calls from Sikh customers inquiring about the discount. The local Kashmiri press expressed its gratitude as well. Kashmir s leading English daily, Greater Kashmir, carried a cartoon of a turban wearing man in a boat holding out a hand to a drowning Kashmiri man. I was touched by their gesture, said Suhail Naqshbandi, the cartoonist. I kept hearing about Khalsa Aid sometime back, when they were working in Syria and other places. Honestly speaking, they have got nothing to do with Kashmir but still they took it upon themselves to offer help. That s why I thought of showing them my version of gratitude. On Wednesday, a group of non local traders and labourers in Srinagar also held protest against attacks on Kashmiris. We are secular For Sikh leaders in Kashmir, the warmth pouring in was yet another example of communal harmony and brotherhood in the Valley. It s a great gesture but it s not for the first time. During floods of 2014, it was our Kashmiri brothers who put us in mosques and provided us with food. So, a gesture like this is not rare in Kashmir, said Jagmohan Singh Raina, chairman of the All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee. Whenever there s a crisis, Kashmiri Muslims distribute food and other items to minorities first. Our secularism is undisputed. People may say anything but the brotherhood and love in our Kashmir is nowhere else. Khalsa Aid representatives also acknowledged the gestures of local Kashmiris. We didn t carry out our work to expect any benefits. Serving humanity is our philosophy. But the way Kashmiri Muslims have reacted, it will send a good message of brotherhood and love, said Gurpreet Singh.\n",

After much speculation and delay over announcement of candidates for the general elections in Odisha beginning April 11, the BJP on Thursday approved the names of candidates for 99 Assembly constituencies and 10 Lok Sabha seats for the upcoming general elections to the Legislative Assembly in Odisha. However, the party is yet to finalise candidates in 13 Assembly constituencies going to polls in first phase and 12 other seats in second phase. The party has fielded 64 new faces including several ministers or MLAs from other parties, including Damodar Rout, Prakash Behera, K Narayan Rao, KusumTete. A total of nine women candidates, including BJP Mahila Morcha unit chief PravatiParida, have been given tickets for the upcoming polls. As the party has re nominated five of its sitting MLAs, it is hopeful of putting up a better show this time. Even as the party has announced candidates for 10 LokSabha seats in the State, it is yet to declare candidates for Kalahandi and Koraput Parliamentary constituencies where elections to be held in first phase. Talks are doing rounds that the party state unity chief Basant Panda is keen to contest from Kalahandi. Similarly, the name of Pradipta Nayak and Arka Keshari Deo are also in the race. While Jayram Pangi is among one of the favourites for the Koraput Lok Sabha seat, the party is in quandary over candidates for Bargarh and Kandhamal. Meanwhile, fresh dissent brews within the party as supporters of party leader from Bhubaneswar, Amiya Das, an aspirant for Ekamra Assembly constituency, staged a sit in front of the party headquarter office yesterday. Some disgruntled workers also ransacked office of the party unit in Laxmipur opposing the candidature of Kumuda Saunta today.\n",
      "The Kerala Police said that they had either injured or killed a suspected Maoist in a gun battle that broke out between the armed group and law enforcers in a forested locality near Vythiri in Wayanad district late Wednesday. They said no officer had been injured in the firefight, which was continuing late into the night. Officers said around 10 Maoists, armed with automatic weapons possibly AK 47s, were holding the high ground. A squad of police commandos have pinned them down in a bid to encircle the group and force their surrender. The police said their commandos encountered heavy fire from automatic weapons. They fanned out in battle order, established a skirmish line and returned fire in equal measure. Senior officers have ordered the commandos to proceed with caution so as to not get ambushed by booby traps laid by the retreating Maoists. An officer said the Thunderbolts had given hot pursuit to the Maoists who had arrived at a local resort to demand cash and provision. The armed group had withdrawn into the forest from where they had appeared without warning. The Maoists reportedly fired at the pursuing special forces, who retaliated with automatic fire, aggravating the situation. The Thunderbolts were kitted out with night vision equipment, and GPS and the senior officers were tracking their geospatial position and also the encounter as it unfolded in the dense forests with thick undergrowth. The firefight came against the backdrop of increased activity by various dalams of the Western Ghats Zonal Committee of Maoists in Wayanad and Palakkad districts in a theatrical bid to highlight their presence and deter multiple arms of the government from enforcing peace in the localities. Demands money Earlier, the armed Maoists reached the resort around 9 p.m. and sought food for 10 members of the team. While the resort staff were preparing food for them, some members of the armed group demanded 10,000 from the receptionist. Meanwhile, some staff of the resort informed the police of the presence of the Maoists. When the Thunderbolt commandos reached the site the Maoists tried to escape. The exchange of fire took place around 9.30 p.m. near the resort.\n",
      "FEE ARREARS Budha Dal Public School alleges an ulterior motive Tribune News Service Patiala, April 8 Terming the recent protest by parents and students a sick and wasteful approach the Budha Dal Public School authorities alleged that parents had an ulterior motive. The school authorities said some parents were out to tarnish image of the school. In fact, on Saturday, the school authorities had agreed to allow students, who were earlier denied entry, to attend classes after intervention of the district administration. Calling the protest as unethical , the authorities challenged parents of agitated students, who comprised just four per cent of the total students, to withdraw their wards if they had lost faith in the institution. Dr Amrit Aujla, Principal, Budha Dal Public School, said, If they are dissatisfied with the fee structure then they should immediately withdraw their wards. We are completely sick and tired of this wasteful approach of parents, which is disturbing normal functioning of the school. The school authorities further blamed that none of the protesting parent had paid arrears amounting to Rs 35, 000 to 45,000 per child for any facility used by his her ward for the last four years. Parents should realise that because of their unethical and wasteful activity the future of other 96 per cent students is being jeopardised, the principal said. Meanwhile, the affected parents blamed that despite the school being run by a religious trust, the authorities seemed to be after money, which was unbecoming of any religious body. A member of the Budha Dal Parent Association, JS Sodhi, said, Firstly, they did not comply with the order of Punjab Education Secretary. Now, they do not want to abide by the court orders. Parents allege discrimination Following court orders, parents alleged that the school authorities were discriminating against students and even insulting some of them in classes. They said the school had issued temporary paper ID cards to students. JS Sodhi said children were given temporary ID cards only to make them realise that they had not paid the fee. He alleged that teachers were insulting students in the class.\n",

      "Jagatsinghpur Tension erupted at Mundala Chhak in Naugaon area of the district after clashes broke out between two groups of BJD workers during a poll campaign. According to sources, volunteers of Jagatsinghpur BJD leader Amarendra Das allegedly stopped the supporters of local party candidate Prasant Muduli while the latter was conducting a roadshow near Mundala Chhak. Das supporters waived black flags and also protested the roadshow organised by Muduli. The situation turned ugly when members of both the groups had a heated argument and later entered into a scuffle. Asked about the incident, Muduli said, There may be some disgruntlement in those candidates, who did not get ticket for the elections, but in my opinion, the Congress party was behind the incident. The Opposition party has intentionally tried to conspire against me but people have proved that they are with me. It may be noted that infighting in party s Jagatsinghpur unit has hit fever pitch after the party denied poll ticket to local aspirant Amarendra Das and instead nominated Balikuda Ersama MLA Prasant Muduli for the seat.\n",
      "Employees of Jharkhand State Sports Promotion Society protest at mega sports complex in Hotwar, Ranchi, on Friday. Picture by Manob Chowdhary Over 300 members of the service staff working for sports academies being run at the mega sports complex at Hotwar held a demonstration on Friday to demand immediate payment of salaries that are due since January. Because of the demonstration, which began at 9.30am and continued till 3.30pm, gates 1 and 2 of the complex on the outskirts of the state capital were blocked. This meant that cadets of the sports academies could neither enter nor leave the complex during the time. Vikrant Malhan, member security of Jharkhand State Sport Promotion Society JSSPS that runs the academies, said the staff, including sweepers, guards and gardeners, called off their agitation after state sports department officials assured them that their dues would be cleared in 10 days. Officials of the Sports Authority of Jharkhand SAJHA reached the venue and assured the staff that they would be paid within 10 days after which they called off the demonstration. There was no major disturbance, Malhan claimed. JSSPS was formed under the Societies Registration Act 1860 after the state sports department signed an MoU with PSU Central Coalfields CCL in June 2015 to run several sports academies and a sports university as an autonomous entity. Currently, the academies are training over 200 children who have been selected on the basis of their talent from various parts of the country. JSSPS chief executive officer Jitendera Tiwari said over Rs 5 crore was required to pay the salaries of the service staff. Deputy director Jharkhand sports authority Ved Ratna claimed the delay was due to procedural lapses and pending paper work. The sports society gets funds from the state government and CCL. A lot of documentation is needed to access funds. Utilisation certificates of previous year s fund have to be presented and approval of the state government is required to transfer funds to JSSPS. We hope to complete these formalities within 10 days, Ratna said. Manoj Prasad, an ex serviceman who was leading Friday s demonstration, said such delays were particularly bad for those with low salaries. While a private security guard gets Rs 11,425 a month, a sweeper or gardener is supposed to get Rs 7,000 a month. If this is not paid on time, there is bound to be resentment. The state government and CCL should complete the required paper work on time, he told The Telegraph.\n",

The HSPCB s action was in compliance with the directions of the National Green Tribunal NGT . The farmers staged a dharna at the gate of the mill and stopped HSPCB officials from leaving the premises till they agreed to fulfil the demand for giving the mill relaxation for a month.

If the mill is sealed, farmers will incur losses, said Rampal Chahal, president, Ganna Sangharsh Samiti, Bhadson. Farmers had already paid the labour cost for harvesting and clearing of sugarcane, he said, adding that neither the mill authorities nor HSPCB officials were considerate towards farmers plight.

The school does not receive any grant and in spite of the government s announcement of grant two years ago, no fund has been received thus far. As a result, teachers have been deprived of their salaries for more than two years and are facing starvation. As recourse, the school authorities in exasperation have decided to shut down the school. An angry Panchayat convened a meeting in the Guhiyapal Odiya High School premises which was presided by Benudhar Panda. It was decided in the meeting that either the government takes acquisition of the institution or the entire Panchayat would boycott the Lok Sabha polls. People attending the meeting said that students from five Panchayats came to attend classes in the school. If the school was shut, they feared that the students would have to cover an additional distance of 15 kilometers to attend Odiya classes in another school at Khandamouda. As a result, many students would be deprived of education. They further informed that students from far flung areas like Kesarda, Angarpara, Arjunbera and many villages of Purnapani Panchayat come to this school for education. We have submitted letters of demand to the Chief Minister, Education Minister and the parliamentarian demanding government acquisition of the school but they have shown no interest in the matter, said an angry Guhiyapal villager. The mood of the Panchayat denizens is far from happy towards the government and people s representative.

      "Clashes broke out between prisoners and the staff at Central Jail Srinagar after the rumours of shifting of inmates outside Kashmir because of repair work on the premises surfaced. Reports said trouble started on Thursday night in the Central Jail as the inmates resisted the prison authorities move to shift them from the two barracks marked for renovation. A police official said the prisoners thought that they would be shifted to jails outside the valley and went on a rampage setting on fire gas cylinders and vandalising jail property. At least two barracks and the jail mess were set on fire. Reports said that two inmates were injured in the clashes. J K Director General of Police and Prisons Dilbagh Singh confirmed that the inmates burnt a structure within the facility. Some inmates instigated others to stop the repair and reinforcement works inside a barrack. Others jail inmates joined and resorted to some violent acts on the jail staff. They also set some place on fire, he said. As the news about clashes within the jail spread, authorities suspended Internet services in Srinagar and south Kashmir areas. Security forces were deployed in old city areas to prevent protests. Jail under NIA radar The Srinagar Central Jail attracted the attention of the security agencies after Lashker e Taiba commander Naveed Jatt alias Abu Hunzullah, who was lodged there, escaped from a hospital while being taken for medical check up on February 6 last year. Two policemen were killed by the militants at Srinagar's S M H S Hospital during the incident. The National Investigation Agency NIA raided the Jail premises in March 2018 and recovered over two dozen mobile phones, incriminating documents, a Pakistani flag and jihadi literature. Months before this, Jammu and Kashmir CID had termed Srinagar the jail as a hub for recruiting militants with inmates establishing a parallel administrative set up . In a shocking revelation the CID report mentioned that the role of the jail is so important that every new militant is only recruited after approval from inside the prison. Immediately after Jatt s escape, prisoners who fall in higher and high risk category were shifted secretly to various prisons in Jammu region including Udhampur, Kotbalwal and Hiranagar. Jatt, who was allegedly involved in the killing of veteran journalist Shujaat Bukhari on 14 June 2018, was later killed in an encounter with security forces on November 28 in central Kashmir s Budgam district.\n",

Reports said that scores of the residents, including men, women and children, gathered at Parade Ground Chowk and staged a sit in for several hours. As a result, traffic also remained affected. The residents demanded that the authorities must take measures to end the water shortage. Later, an officer of the department, Abhay, reached the spot and tried to pacify the protesters.

      "Days after the Bharatiya Janata Party won assembly elections in Tripura, the Communist Party of India Marxist in Tripura accused it of unleashing concerted violence against its workers and vandalising its offices. In a memorandum submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, the CPI M alleged that 514 of its workers had been injured, with more than 1,500 homes attacked purportedly by BJP supporters. In addition, it claimed 350 of its offices had been ransacked or captured by the newly elected party. This is not just an attack on our party, said CPI M leader Jitendra Chaudhury. This is an attack on our Constitution, our fundamental rights. Chaudhury, who is one of the two Lok Sabha members from Tripura, claimed the party s workers were being attacked in broad daylight by lethal weapons and petrol bombs . He alleged the attackers had the tacit support of the BJP s senior leaders. There are being instigated, this is an organised attack, he said. The parliamentarian said that the jubilant reactions of top BJP leaders to the destruction of a statue of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, or Lenin, by alleged BJP supporters in a town called Belonia in the state s southern district was testament to the saffron party s endorsement of violence. Ram Madhav the party s national general secretary justified the vandalism in a tweet, he alleged. They are sowing the seeds of hatred in Tripura. In a tweet that has since been deleted, Madhav had written People taking down Lenin s statue not in Russia it is in Tripura. Chalo Paltai . Chalo Paltai Let s change was the war cry of the BJP s election campaign in Tripura. On Tuesday, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh called the governor of Tripura, Tathagata Roy, and asked him to ensure peace till the new government took charge. On Monday, Roy had expressed support for the razing of the Lenin statue. What one democratically elected government can do another democratically elected government can undo. And vice versa https t.co Og8S1wjrJs Tathagata Roy tathagata2 March 5, 2018 We reject these charges The Bharatiya Janata Party s spokesperson in the state, Mrinal Kanti Deb, however, rejected the charges against its leaders and workers. He alleged it was a conspiracy by the CPI M to disturb the law and order of the state. People have changed their colours overnight, he said. A lot of Left workers after our victory started identifying themselves as the BJP workers. They are the ones involved in the few sporadic violent activities that may have taken place. But once our government takes charge, all of them will be sent to jail. Several people in the state said that violence was quite widespread. In every village there has been violence, said a rubber planter from Santirbazar in South Tripura. This is really disappointing because this is not what I had voted the BJP for. I hope the party s senior leaders take action. They can t just say they are not our workers. Said an Agartala based businessman Yes, there has been violence, but it only natural. There were a lot of pent up emotions among people. The Left, after all, had been in power for 25 years. Post poll violence regular fare Political observers point out that post poll violence in Tripura is not a new occurrence. It happened in 2013, in 2008, in 2003, so there s nothing really new, said an Agartala based political analyst. But it does seem that there has been a quick turnover this time, a lot of low level Left leaders seem to have changed loyalties. Miscreants understand which side to be on, and as newcomers you have to prove your worth, that s how it works everywhere. Tapas Dey, a veteran Congress leader and former legislator, said the CPI M had only itself to blame. Post poll violence is a legacy that the Left had left behind, claimed Dey. They are doing this hue and cry this time because they are facing the heat. But the truth is they have created this culture. Electoral violence is common in Tripura. In the run up to the state elections, both the CPI M and the BJP lost several of their workers in violent clashes that would routinely break out between the two parties. Government officials, however, said that violence was beginning to taper off, beginning Monday evening. Things are under control, said a senior state government official. There are prohibitory orders in some places but that s only a preventive measure. A top official of the district administration of Sepahijala, one of the two districts where Section 144 was imposed on Sunday, said there had been sporadic clashes. He claimed many of these clashes were personal that had been given political colour . Both parties are involved, he said on Tuesday evening. This happens after election results in Tripura and we expect things to be completely normal by tomorrow.\n",

      "Members of the Assam Tea Tribes Students Association ATTSA and workers on Thursday staged a protest against the management of the Madarkhat tea estate here over non payment of wages. Sanjay Tanti, an estate worker, said, We have been not getting wages for two months. We don t know what we will do. We have urged the management to clear our wages and provident fund but to no avail. We are not getting ration for four months. We are selling utensils to meet family expenses. We appeal to the management to understand our problems and sort out the wage issue as soon as possible, said Kajal Tasa, another worker. ATTSA publicity secretary Lakhindra Kurmi said, On Wednesday, we held a meeting with the management seeking release of the workers wages. However, the management said they could not release the wages because of the garden s poor financial condition. Kurmi alleged the tea estate staff are not getting salary for eight months. The gardens has 500 permanent workers and their condition was pathetic because of non payment of wages. Despite several pleas to the district administration, it is not taking any initiative to solve the issue, he said. We urged the state government and the district administration to intervene in the matter. We want the matter to be sorted out within a week or we might be forced to launch an intense agitation, an ATTSA member said.\n",
      "Not many people gather on sultry afternoons on a working day to march together. But that is what happened on Thursday when hundreds of women met at Ramlila Maidan in Moulali and set off for Shyambazar, raising their voice about what women want from these elections. What do women want Women want change. From war, violence and hate, but the starting point seemed to be the recognition of their many identities. Before the march started around 3.30pm, some of the women spoke about what prompted the march. Who are we We are a gathering of transgendered, transsexual, working class, Dalit, Muslim and disabled women, said the first speaker, who remained invisible surrounded by the crowds. If that sounded like a roll call of identities, it was important, said a participant in the rally, because inclusiveness is meant to break down the monolithic, homogeneous, mainstream idea of anything . In this case the idea of a woman, passed down socially and culturally without any questioning. Participants at Thursday s rally. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha Filmmaker and actor Aparna Sen, who spoke at the start of the march, stressed the point. Women of all identities should find equal opportunity of work and livelihood, she said. The participants had come from the city and neighbouring districts. They were all there as individuals and not representatives of any organisation. But they carried posters, banners and sometimes entire saris, on which were inscribed messages for the powers that be. Not that they only stood for the messages they were carrying. Nargis Ara from Diamond Harbour, a grass roots activist who works with a support group for women who have experienced domestic violence, for example, was carrying a poster that spoke for the rights of the disabled woman. But Ara spoke about her work and what she considers are the most important issues of women. Participants at Thursday s rally. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha After working with her organisation for almost a decade, she feels that women speak about it more now. But domestic violence continues unabated its nature may have changed, but its extent remains undiminished. She wants the new government to bring in an environment where there will be no further polarisation along the line of religion. The new government should also address what the Muslim woman feels about triple talaq. Many of us feel that it should come under the jurisdiction of civil law and not criminal law, said Ara, her voice often drowned by the sloganeering going on, demanding liberty, equality and justice. By the time the march winded up at Shyambazar around 6pm, the cry had become one unanimous one for change, badal . Change from the climate of war and violence to one of peace, democracy and the right to dissent. As women voters, we want to tell our politicians that our vote will be for issues that matter and we will vote for democracy, peace, justice and harmony and against fascism, hate and divisive politics, said Anuradha Kapoor, an activist. The Calcutta march was part of a nationwide protest taking place almost simultaneously in 15 states and 146 cities of India. It was a rare sight. Men and women lined up along the sides of the road along Moulali, Sealdah and Maniktala areas to watch the procession. A woman s face lit up when she was handed a leaflet listing the women s demands. But another woman, who had arrived at Sealdah from Burdwan, said she did not know what to think of it. In many men, the march produced bewilderment. Please tell me what to think of it, an elderly man said, when asked what he thought of the march. Women already have the vote, he added. At the same time, a young man came and asked for several leaflets, saying he would distribute them among his friends.\n",
      "Tribune News Service Karnal, April 9 The Piccadilly sugar mill, Bhadson, was closed on Wednesday in the middle of the crushing season, forcing hundreds of farmers to protest. The mill authorities claimed they had taken the step in compliance with the order of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board HSPCB and the National Green Tribunal NGT , while farmers are demanding relaxation of one month for the sale of the remaining produce. Under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union and the Ganna Sangharsh Samiti, the farmers started a dharna at the gate of the mill and threatened to intensify the protest on Wednesday. Darpan Kamboj, Indri tehsildar and Randhir Singh, DSP, tried to pacify the farmers, but to no avail. The HSPCB had warned us of dire consequences if the mill was not closed. We had no other option. We are with the farmers, but we cannot go against the NGT order, said Karam Singh, adviser to the mill. He said 52.75 lakh quintals of sugarcane had been crushed in the current season, while 69 lakh quintals were crushed last year. Rampal Chahal, president, Ganna Sangharsh Samiti, said they were assured by the authorities a few days ago that the mill would continue to operate, but it was stopped on Tuesday without any prior information. Farmers came with sugarcane and were stopped from unloading their crop. We are only demanding relaxation of one month, so that farmers can sell their produce, he said. Later in the evening, the authorities informed the farmers that their remaining crop would be adjusted in other mills, which sparked anger and they blocked a road. They were pacified by farmer leaders, following which they removed the blockade. They, however, announced to hold a kisan panchayat on Wednesday at the mill to discuss their future course of action. We have been informed that the sugarcane of the farmers will be shifted to other mills, which is not acceptable to farmers. We will approach CM Manohar Lal Khattar, said Chahal. A group of farmers later reached the district headquarters to meet Deputy Commissioner Vinay Partap Singh.\n",

      "Clashes broke out between prisoners and the staff at Central Jail Srinagar after the rumours of shifting of inmates outside Kashmir because of repair work on the premises surfaced. Reports said trouble started on Thursday night in the Central Jail as the inmates resisted the prison authorities move to shift them from the two barracks marked for renovation. A police official said the prisoners thought that they would be shifted to jails outside the valley and went on a rampage setting on fire gas cylinders and vandalising jail property. At least two barracks and the jail mess were set on fire. Reports said that two inmates were injured in the clashes. J K Director General of Police and Prisons Dilbagh Singh confirmed that the inmates burnt a structure within the facility. Some inmates instigated others to stop the repair and reinforcement works inside a barrack. Others jail inmates joined and resorted to some violent acts on the jail staff. They also set some place on fire, he said. As the news about clashes within the jail spread, authorities suspended Internet services in Srinagar and south Kashmir areas. Security forces were deployed in old city areas to prevent protests. Jail under NIA radar The Srinagar Central Jail attracted the attention of the security agencies after Lashker e Taiba commander Naveed Jatt alias Abu Hunzullah, who was lodged there, escaped from a hospital while being taken for medical check up on February 6 last year. Two policemen were killed by the militants at Srinagar's S M H S Hospital during the incident. The National Investigation Agency NIA raided the Jail premises in March 2018 and recovered over two dozen mobile phones, incriminating documents, a Pakistani flag and jihadi literature. Months before this, Jammu and Kashmir CID had termed Srinagar the jail as a hub for recruiting militants with inmates establishing a parallel administrative set up . In a shocking revelation the CID report mentioned that the role of the jail is so important that every new militant is only recruited after approval from inside the prison. Immediately after Jatt s escape, prisoners who fall in higher and high risk category were shifted secretly to various prisons in Jammu region including Udhampur, Kotbalwal and Hiranagar. Jatt, who was allegedly involved in the killing of veteran journalist Shujaat Bukhari on 14 June 2018, was later killed in an encounter with security forces on November 28 in central Kashmir s Budgam district.\n",

Doctors under the umbrella of NEIGRIHMS Resident Doctors Association NRDA have called for a total shutdown of medical services from Thursday to mount pressure on the Union health ministry to remove the demanding the immediate removal of incumbent director of the institute. AL Hek in his statement appealed to all doctors to desist from strike or shutdown in NEIGRIHMS in the interest of the patients. I have already had a meeting with the agitating resident doctors and they have decided to call off the strike after the meeting in my chamber, Hek said. The Association has also dashed a letter to the Union health ministry seeking immediate intervention into the grievances. The president of the association, Dr Synrang Batngen Warjri said that there was no other option left but to save the institute from further devastation which was why, this total shutdown of services was called from today April 4 till the incumbent autocratic director is removed repatriated from the post. In a 13 point letter submitted to the Centre, the association said that since the joining of the director there has been de recognition of Post Graduate seats including the department of anaesthesia, general surgery, radiology, and general medicine due to lack of administrative will. The Association also said that faculties are resigning from various departments including the department of medical oncology, anaesthesia, gynaecology and obstetrics, paediatric, radiology, orthopaedics which added more problems to the institute and affecting the people of North East India. He also said that some of the faculties like department of obstetrics and gynaecology, department of cardiology are being forcefully removed by the director for reasons best known to him. The association also accused the director of harassing students through his accomplices by interfering with the examination process of students, thesis, submissions, and disbursement of salaries. This is very unbecoming and a shameful act by an autocratic director. The association strongly believes that a teacher trying to destroy the career of his own student can never work for welfare of an institute, Warjri said. Hek said that such a shutdown of medical services would affect the patients and it may even result to loss of valuable lives. From the side of the state government, we have taken cognizance of the serious matter and upon being informed about the shutdown by the agitating doctors, I have taken up the matter with officials of ministry of health and family welfare to resolve the matter, Hek said. He informed that letters have also been sent from his side to the director of NEIGRIHMS and agitating doctors to resolve all issues and desist from such extreme action which would result in difficulties to patients. Urging the agitating doctors to desist from shutdown, Hek assured that their grievances would be addressed at the earliest. Only a few months back, I met the Union health minister, JP Nadda along with chief minister, Conrad K Sangma in New Delhi and the minister has assured to take action to resolve all outstanding issues, Hek said.\n",
      "Residents on Monday blocked the Barnala Mansa road at Dhaula village to press for their demand of upgrading Government High School, Dhaula, to senior secondary level. At least six protesters climbed atop a community water tank. The police remained soft on protestors in the wake of the recent double suicide case at Jodhpur village in the district. Even women and girls joined the protesters, braving the sweltering heat. The dharna was lifted in the evening after additional deputy commissioner ADC Amandeep Bansal assured the protesters of school upgrade without specifying any timeline. The villagers, protesting under the banner Dhaula School Upgradaton Action Committee , had put banners announcing boycott of political parties till their demand was met with. Action committee leader Beant Bajwa said, Many of the protesters climbed the water tank and were ready to immolate themselves. We are frustrated with the administrative machinery remaining non responsive to our long pending demand. The government is always ready to open liquor vends, but here we have to struggle to get a school upgraded. Gursewak Dhaula, another protester, said, In case the government does not fulfill its promise to upgrade the school, we will resume our agitation. Shiromani Akali Dal SAD leader Darbara Singh Guru said, The state government in the recent budget had earmarked a sum of Rs 225 crore for upgrading 800 schools in the state. This school will be upgraded along with other schools. It may take time but upgrade is certainly on our priority. I have also talked to education minister Daljeet Singh Cheema on the issue. People are after getting credit and are unnecessarily politicising the matter. The upgrade is on the cards, said Guru. Additional deputy commissioner ADC Amandeep Bansal said, The proposal for upgrading about 20 schools in the district has been under consideration with the DPI secondary and Dhaula school is one of them. We are hopeful that the proposal would go through before the month end. Barnala sub divisional magistrate SDM Amarveer Singh Sidhu said, We do not have the jurisdiction to do anything on the matter. But the proposal for upgrading the school is already under consideration and it takes time for finalisation. Village sarpanch Ram Singh said, The school, opened about five decades back, has two sections in Class 10 and three sections in Class 9. Those passing matriculation go to Barnala, Rureke Kalan and Pakho to take admission in Class 11. We are worried about our girls. Our village population is approximately 18,000. The protest is purely a publicity stunt. District education officer secondary Harkanwaljit Kaur said, The school fulfills all norms for upgrade. It has 602 students and there is no senior secondary school in the radius of 5 kilometeres. Today I had a meeting with the DPI secondary and he has assured upgrade this month. Classes for senior secondary will start this session. DPI Secondary , Balbir Singh Dhol said, We have received about 350 proposals for upgrading high schools to senior secondary level. The entire lot of proposal will be cleared in a few days. The Dhaula school fulfills all requirements for upgrade, said Dhol. First Published May 10, 2016 15 02 IST\n",

      "Protest We are fighting for means of survival. We are not asking for luxurious flats, says Lathika, one of the protesters. Kerala may be widely recognised as a benchmark for development not only in India, but across the world too. But for hundreds of Adivasi and Dalit families in the state, the promise of the Kerala model of development has remained just that, a promise that seems endlessly deferred. For over four years, hundreds of these landless families from Arippa in the state s Kollam district have been locked in an agitation spearheaded by the Adivasi Dalit Munnetta Samithi. For the last 300 days, over 350 families have brought this protest to the doorstep of the government, undertaking a serial protest in front of the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram. Every day for the last 10 months, at least 10 Adivasi and Dalit families from Arippa have been gathering outside the Secretariat demanding that the government fulfil a promise made to them that they will all be given enough land to earn a basic livelihood. Omana Kalaketti, Vice president of the Adivasi Dalit Munnetta Samithi, tells TNM, We are demanding agricultural land for our survival. We have no educational qualifications to get government jobs or any other profession. Agriculture is our only means of survival. If the government does not want to give us the land, how do we fill our stomachs Left behind by land reforms Behind this protracted struggle of the Arippa agitation is a long history of uneven development in Kerala that has left the state s Adivasis and Dalits struggling to eke out a livelihood on the margins. As an article by Sanal Mohan in The Hindu Business Line observes, Adivasis historically lost out to peasant communities migrating into tribal territories from other parts of the state, bringing with them new concepts of land ownership that disrupted the traditional claim that Adivasis had on their land. Dalits, on the other hand, were disabled by caste from staking claim to agricultural land. When Kerala carried out its historic land reforms, one of the most successful such programmes in the country, these Dalit families only received ownership for small household plots, but not to agricultural land. As CK Janu, one of the major Adivasi activists in Kerala once told The Hindu, The Land Reforms Act enacted in the Kerala State in the 1960s helped thousands of landless tenants realise their dream of owning land but it also denied justice to tribal people. Though a 1975 law by Parliament made it mandatory for Kerala to return alienated to Adivasi communities, this has never gone sufficiently beyond paper. And while successive governments have launched initiatives like the Zero Landless Scheme, Dalit and Adivasi families like those led by the ADMS are still waiting for these to materialise. Pushpalatha, a 42 year old Arippa farmer, echoes the sentiments of many of those protesting outside the Secretariat when she says that the least the government can do is provide them the meagre resources to stand on their own feet. I have four children. Our only source of income is agriculture. We grow grains, tapioca, spinach and other vegetables in these lands. The land that I have been farming belongs to a wealthy landowner of the region. I have been toiling on farm lands all my life now, and it hurts not to have a piece of land in my or my family s name. At least give us land on patta, so that we don t have to depend on others to feed us, says Pushpalatha. Pushpalatha, a 42 year old Arippa farmer. Lack of resources or government indifference Omana says that the protesting families in Arippa have been denied land for years on the pretext of a lack of government land. But, this is not really the case, she alleges. The government authorities always cite lack of revenue land as the reason for not allotting Adivasis and Dalits farmlands. We are tired of listening to the same excuse for years. We did a survey with the help of some Adivasi activists and we now know that more than two and a half lakh acres of land is under the possession of the government. The officials don t feel the necessity to help those who are suffering, she says. Dhanya Raman, another activist involved with the Arippa struggle, agrees. It is not an unavailability of land but an unwillingness to help marginalised farmers that stands in the way, she too alleges. The government revenue land in Thiruvananthapuram alone is recorded to be more than 16000 acres. It s not that the government doesn t have land it is an unwillingness to help the poor. They have been protesting for so long and their demands have only fallen on deaf ears , said Dhanya. Lathika, a 54 year old woman participating in the fast outside the Secretariat on Thursday, says that her arrest for land encroachment accurately reflects the attitude of the government to their demands. Earlier this year, says Lathika, she and 11 others were arrested after they and others attempted to take revenue land in Pallickal village in Thiruvananthapuram that had been promised by officials. She spent 14 days in jail. There are about 14 acres of government revenue land in Pallickal village in Thiruvananthapuram. Of this, officials announced that 25 cents of land each would be given to farmers in Chengara. That remained as a promise. So, we had encroached on the land and put up our tents. The next morning an army of police officers circled out tents. Many people ran out of fear and 11 of us were taken into custody , narrates Lathika. The struggle continues Omana says that repeated negotiations have not yielded any fruitful results for the Arippa agitators. On November 6, there was a meeting with the Kollam District Collector, where he promised one acre of land each for Adivasis. But that excludes Dalits and landless farmers from the general category. The officials decided to allocate only three cents of land for Dalits and general category farmers. We will continue to protest until our demands are met, says Omana. The protesters have two demands for the government All landless Dalit and Adivasi farmers be given one acre of land each. Other landless farmers who are neither Adivasi nor Dalit be given 50 cents of land each. With their protests thus far having fallen on deaf ears, the Arippa protesters intend to intensify their protest, beginning with a 48 hour fast outside the Secretariat on Thursday and Friday. Following this, the protests will be expanded with more Dalit and Adivasi families planned to be brought into it. After all, says Lathika, theirs is not an extravagant demand, but only for a right to livelihood. When will they give us land When will they learn to keep their promises We are fighting for means of survival. We are not asking for luxurious flats, she says. Edited by Rakesh Mehar\n",
      "Ravinder Sood Palampur, April 4 A large number of residents of Laharu village in Sulaha constituency, 25 km from here, called on SDM Dheera today and conveyed their decision to boycott the parliamentary elections in protest against the failure of the state government to construct a road to their village. SDM Dheera Sanjay Kumar that he had received a memorandum and forwarded the same to Deputy Commissioner Kangra Sandeep Kumar, who is also returning officer, for further action. The villagers have already started an agitation and lodged their protest before different government agencies. Only yesterday they had blocked the motorcade of Health Minister Vipan Singh Parmar and Kangra BJP candidate Krishan Kapoor when they were on election campaign in Sulaha constituency. Villagers also shouted slogans Road nahi to vote nahin . Addressing media persons here, villagers said the state government had failed to construct only one kilometre road to their village. They said almost every village of Sulaha had been provided roads but their village lacked this facility. They said when Congress leader Jagjivan Pal was an MLA from Sulaha, they had called on him several times but all in vain. Sulaha has been represented by senior BJP leader and Health Minister Vipan Singh Parmar, who too had failed to solve the issues despite assurances given to them time and again. However, the health minister, while talking to The Tribune, refuted the charges of villagers and said he was ready to construct the road and there was no shortage of funds. He said a few villagers are not allowing construction of the road through their land. Untill and unless the land was not provided to government it was difficult for the PWD to go ahead with the work. I have requested the agitating villagers to sit and sort out the issue and then come to me. Construction of road will be started soon after the model code of conduct is over. The government was also ready to acquire land by paying compensation at market rate. Still consent of the owner was needed , he said.\n",

      "Two days after Kar Sewa activists demolished a portion of the Darshani Deori of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, around two dozen local Sikhs and eyewitnesses lodged a formal complaint against the outfit and employees of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee SGPC on Monday. The complainants demanded action against Kar Sewa head Baba Jagtar Singh and the SGPC employees who work at the Darbar Sahib and its manager Partap Singh for demolishing the two century old structure. Around 400 goons bearing sharp edged weapons demolished the darshani deori at the behest of Baba Jagtar Singh and in presence of the Darbar Sahib manager Partap Singh and employees of the SGPC. The accused have hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community and should be booked under Section 295A deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs of the Indian Penal Code IPC , the complaint reads.

On being asked why the SGPC had not lodged a police complaint against Kar Sewa till now, Siyalka said, The Sikh sangat has lodged the complaint. We will consider filing a complaint after completing our report. BRAHMPURA, KHALRA DEMAND ACTION AGAINST CULPRITS Those who filed the complaint also alleged the SGPC and the Kar Sewa heads were hands in glove and therefore the gurdwara body had not lodged any police complaint. Different organisations of the Sikh community, including Guru Maneyo Granth Sewak Jatha, Himmat e Khalsa Jatha, and leaders, MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and PEP Khadoor Sahib candidate Bibi Paramjit Kaur Khalra, demanded action against those involved in the demolition. SGPC member Gurbachan Singh Karmuwala was involved in the demolition of the deori.

On Monday, members of the SAD also held a protest outside the gurdwara. Meanwhile, activists of an alliance of Sikh organisations have demanded that a criminal case be registered against Baba Jagtar Singh. The alliance s spokesperson Sukhdev Singh Phagwara said , It was an attempt to earn money from the pilgrims in the name of constructing a new building. Kar Sewa activists demolished the gate without taking the SGPC or the Sikh community in loop. They should be booked for hurting religious sentiments. First Published Apr 02, 2019 14 10 IST\n",
      "By Express News Service BHUBANESWAR Three BJP leaders including party candidate for Saraskana Assembly constituency Dr Bhudan Murmu on Thursday staged dharna near Naveen Nivas, the residence of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, protesting the delay in relieving the doctor from Government service.Murmu, a doctor in Rangamatia primary health centre of Mayurbhanj district, visited the Chief Minister s residence demanding acceptance of his application for voluntary retirement from service. After reaching Naveen Nivas, the BJP team comprising party s State vice president Samir Mohanty and general secretary Lekhashri Samantsinghar sought an audience with the Chief Minister to request his intervention in the matter. Murmu is not getting clear picture on the status of his application. While some say his file is in the office of the Chief Secretary, others claim that Murmu s application is pending for approval of the Chief Minister, Samantsinghar said. As filing of nominations for fourth phase to six Parliamentary seats including Mayurbhanj begins from Thursday, we thought it prudent to seek the intervention of the Chief Minister. As Naveen was away for campaign, we meet his political secretary but did not get a definite reply, she said.The BJP leader said the Chief Minister is deliberately not accepting his resignation as he is afraid that Murmu might win the elections from Saraskana. Murmu said he had applied for voluntary retirement from service VRS on October 4 last year. However, the State Government has not relieved him from service even after six months.Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had also lambasted the Chief Minister for not accepting Murmu s resignation. I want to ask Naveen Patnaik why is he not accepting Murmu s resignation. The doctor has the right to contest elections. If Works Secretary Nalini Pradhan could be given clearance from Vigilance and other approvals overnight despite several charges against him, why is the Government not accepting Murmu s resignation Pradhan questioned.Earlier on March 26, the BJD had moved Chief Electoral Officer Surendra Kumar alleging that BJP has violated the Model Code of Conduct by nominating Murmu as its candidate for the elections and further engaging him in campaigning.\n",

      "3 Shares GWC Zakura college was earlier operating from inside Amar Singh College Srinagar Fourth semester students of a government women s college that was operating from inside Amar Singh College Srinagar are resenting their shift to the new campus, which they say is far off for them. The students are also not content with choice of another college offered to them, as it doest offer the subject combinations . Scores of students of Government Women s College Zakura, Wednesday staged a strong protest at Srinagar s Press Enclave against the move. The students of the 2017 batch had enrolled at the college while it was operating from inside AS College in Gogji Bagh Srinagar. Now they are finding it difficult to reach to Batpora area in Zakura, where the college campus has come up, in another end of the city, almost on the outskirts. Their seniors, the 5th semester students, they said, have been accommodated at the AS College itself. Even though the Higher Education Department had recently said that the students would be adjusted in nearby colleges as per their convenience , the infuriated students rubbished the claims. We were not even told that the college is going to be shifted. At the time of admission, they told us that our graduation will be completed at the AS College premises, one of the students said. We had even applied for migration in our 3rd semester but they assured us that it won t be shifted for time being, another student claimed. We won t leave the college, she added. Students pursuing Islamic Studies told Kashmir Reader that the Nawa Kadal College in Srinagar, where they were opted to move, does not offer the subjects we have opted . There are certain subject combinations, which are not available at all at the college. We won t leave the college, added another student. Moreover, the students said, the college hasn t provided them transport facility. As we have to travel from far flung areas, none of the two colleges, are feasible for us another protestor explained. Principal of the College, Maheen Mustafa told Kashmir Reader that they could not adjust the 4th semester students, because their counterparts at the college have been enrolled by the Cluster University, Srinagar and not Kashmir University, to which the Women s College is affiliated. The 5th semester students at AS College and at our college, both are affiliated to Kashmir University, that is why we could enrol them at AS College, she clarified. Bio Social Latest Posts Loading...

      "Aspirants of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Post Graduation NEET PG approached the Directorate of Medical Education and Research DMER on Tuesday, to express their anxiety over reservations. Implementation of both the Economically Weaker Section EWS and the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes SEBC and reservation together has brought down the number of seats available to postgraduate PG students from the general category. While the DMER said it was simply following the directives of the State government, it agreed to set up a meeting between the aspirants and the General Administration Department. With admissions closing in less than two months, PG aspirants from the open category and their parents staged a silent protest outside the DMER office in Fort on Tuesday, before meeting the director. They asked the DMER and State CET Cell not to compromise the open category seats. Seats not increased Sudha Shenoy, a parent said, The Centre has not applied the EWS reservation, but the State has, along with reservations for the SEBC. We do not understand the rush for the State to do so. The All India Quota does not include the EWS quota, as the seats were not increased. The State has implemented the quotas without fulfilling the requirement of increasing the seats, Ms. Shenoy said. Dr. Anjali Meswani, another parent, said, While there are fewer open category seats for the most sought after specialities, more seats are available in the non clinical branches such as anatomy, pharmacology, pathology, microbiology and preventive medicine, which are non interactive and less sought after. Students are upset at not getting admission to their preferred colleges despite scoring well. I have scored a State rank of 77, but I could not get a seat in the city or State for internal medicine. With the same rank, I would have easily got into Sion Hospital until last year. I have now been pushed to Surat. This is injustice, Neil Prabhu 22 , an applicant, said. Akshaya Sathyamurthy, another PG aspirant, said students with much lower ranks were getting admission in the State under reservation. This is a depressing situation for the open category aspirants, she said. No role to play The DMER and State CET Cell, meanwhile, have said they have no role to play in the matter and are simply following the two Government Resolutions issued by the State to implement the SEBC and EWS quotas. While private colleges now have 37 out of 469 seats in the State for open category aspirants, government colleges have 233 out of 972 seats. Dr. Tatyarao Lahane, Director, DMER, said, We have been advised to implement reservation for academics. These resolutions come under the Government Administration Department and Law Department of the State government. Our department does not take these decisions. Anand Rayate, Commissioner, State CET Cell, and secretary, Admissions Regulating Authority, said the cell cannot make any changes, as it does not set the policies. Mr. Rayate told The Hindu, We have communicated to the government that parents and students have issues with the policies on the reservation. Beyond that, we cannot do anything. Hearings this week Parents of the NEET PG aspirants had moved the Bombay High Court in December 2018 seeking protection of the rights of the open category in the State. While the High Court refused to grant interim relief to the petitioners, the matter will be heard by the Supreme Court on Thursday. Similarly, on March 25, a group of five aspirants petitioned the HC for a stay on the reservation for EWS. The High Court will hear this matter on Wednesday.\n",

There was lathicharge on supporters in districts like Malda, Murshidabad, where they were not given permission to hold rallies and hundreds were detained by the police authorities. BJP Mahila Morcha President Locket Chatterjee alleged that permission for bike rallies were denied as Mamata Banerjee was scared of losing upcoming elections.

Acharia, 75 has been sent to critical care unit of the Purulia Deben Mahato District Hospital. Acharia was thrashed in front of the police which remained a mute spectator. The alleged attack comes a day after seven time CPM parliamentarian, Ram Chandra Dome, was assaulted in Birbhum, the report adds. Basudeb along with another former CPIM legislator was leading a group of 100 party candidates to Kashipur development office when the incident took place. Panchayat polls in West Bengal are scheduled to be held next month. The ruling Trinamool Congress TMC has been alleged of inciting violence and preventing opposition parties from filing nominations for the polls. The TMC has denied the allegations. Training their guns at the Trinamool Congress, five left parties, including the CPI M , CPI, CPIML, AIFB and SUCI said the ruling party in West Bengal has resorted to full fledged assault on democracy and rule of law, and the panchayat election has started to become a farce . The parties also asked for alternative arrangements for the candidates who were prevented from filling nominations, so that they can register their candidature safely. We strongly protest against the ongoing violence in West Bengal. It is virtual murder of democracy happening in the state. From the declaration of schedule to murderous attacks on opposition candidates in the nomination process, this year's panchayat elections have brought out the authoritarian character of TMC most crudely, CPI M general secretary Sitaram Yechury told reporters. Lashing out at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the state administration, the Left leaders also demanded that firm action should be taken against those indulging in hooliganism, intimidation and encirclement of administrative offices. Over a BJP leader moving the Supreme Court seeking for a direction for deployment of central paramilitary forces to maintain law and order for smooth conduct of the panchayat polls scheduled next month, the Left leaders said their priority is that the state administration should conduct free and fair elections. May be having polls under central forces is not good, but we want the administration should make all arrangements for free and fair elections in Bengal, CPIML leader Kavita Krishnan said. Criticising the State Election Commission, the parties said that the panel has abjectly surrendered and has remained totally insensitive to atrocities committed . The panchayat polls will be held in 20 districts of West Bengal on May 1, 3 and 5. The filing of the nominations began on April 2 and will continue till April 9. With PTI Inputs\n",

      "Protests broke out in several areas in Jammu today against raising of Pakistani flags and pro Pakistan slogans at the rally held by separatist leaders in Srinagar yesterday. Demanding the arrest of separatists, particularly Masarat Alam, protesters burnt effigies of separatist leaders and raised slogans against them, the state government and the Centre. Over a hundred archivists under the banner of Kranti Dal raised slogans against Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and Pakistan and held protest demonstrations at Indira Chowk in the city. Lashing out at the BJP PDP government at the state and the central government for encouraging separatists by releasing Masarat Alam, General Secretary of Kranti Dal Pritem Sharma alleged that Mufti Sayeed was carrying forward the agenda of separatists in the state and BJP was supporting them. Another group of over 150 activists of Jammu West Organisation burnt effigies of Pakistan, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and separatists. Separatists should be arrested and government led by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed should be sacked. Sayeed is carrying forward the agenda of separatists and we will not tolerate them , the organistation's president Sunil Dimple said. A group of Kashmiri Pandits also held protest demonstrations in Muthi area on the outskirts of Jammu city d and charged the Chief Minister with shielding separatist elements. Hundreds of Hindu Shiv Sena workers also staged protest against Hurriyat leaders. They demanded stern action against Masarat Alam and others for chanting pro Pakistan slogans. The protesters blocked transport in many areas of Jammu and burn effigy of Hurriyat leaders including Syed Ali Shah Geelani. After a gap of five years, Jammu and Kashmir Government yesterday allowed Geelani to hold the rally where his supporters including Masarat Alam, released from jail last month, raised pro Pakistan slogans and others waved Pakistani flags. Alam, who was released soon after PDP BJP government came to power in the state, led the march from the Srinagar Airport to Geelani's residence at Hyderpora. Besides the Hurriyat flags, some supporters were also seen carrying Pakistani flags as they chanted pro Pakistan and pro freedom slogans. Lambasting Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Masrat Alam and other separatist leaders of Kashmir, scores of JKNPP activists staged a vociferous protest demonstration outside the Press Club here and burnt the effigy of Alam. JKNPP state president Balwant Singh Mankotia accused the saffron party for its pusillanimous surrender of all the Jammu related core issues before the PDP for the power. Students of Jammu university under the banner of National Students Union of India NSUI led by its state president, Neeraj Kundan, led a protest demonstrations against Mufti government and separatists. Shouting the slogans BJP PDP hai hai, NSUI students gathered outside the main gate of the university and burnt the effigies of Masrat Alam and the government. Neeraj said that Masrat Alam is a huge threat to the nation. Setting him free is the most condemnable part of the story. Once upon there was a time when Modi used to said that his first priority is nation and its glory but those hollow slogans have shown their true value today. If Masrat Alam is not re arrested immediately, NSUI will start nation wide protests against BJP led NDA government and will expose its anti national stuff to the whole country, he added.\n",

      "Residents of Wawonii have staged huge protests demanding the cancellation of mining permits on the island, located in Indonesia s Southeast Sulawesi province. Last week, the deputy governor of Southeast Sulawesi, Lukman Abunawas, said he and Governor Ali Mazi had decided to revoke the permits, promising to do so within 10 days. The announcement came after a video surfaced showing police officers beating a student taking part in the protests. KENDARI, Indonesia A coil of barbed wire separated Southeast Sulawesi Deputy Governor Lukman Abunawas and his police escort from the angry crowd as he read out the statement they had long been waiting for. Over the past two weeks, protests here demanding a permanent stop to mining on the nearby island of Wawonii had turned increasingly violent. College students and anti riot police had exchanged stones and tear gas. Property had been damaged. With each day, more and more farmers were arriving in Kendari, the provincial capital, to join the demonstrations. Lukman had apparently seen enough. I don t want to harm my own family in Wawonii, he announced. I m ready to risk my position and even my life. We will revoke the permits in Wawonii. Lukman is uniquely placed to decide the fates of the mining concessions on Wawonii, an island no larger than New York City. He was the man who issued the permits, back when he was the head of Konawe district. Since then, the authority over mining permits has been transferred to the provincial level. On March 13, Lukman told the crowd he had met with Governor Ali Mazi, and that within 10 days, the permits would be revoked. Lukman also signed a statement to that effect. A few days earlier, after a night in which several policemen were bloodied by rocks hurled from the crowd, students were arrested and two cars were damaged, Governor Ali had called a press conference to announce that he was imposing a temporary halt to mining on Wawonii. But for the island s farmers and those who supported their cause, it wasn t enough. We re fighting for revocation, said Sulhan, chair of the Kendari branch of Indonesia s Muslim Students Association, or HMI. We don t want a moratorium. We want the permits to be cancelled. Since 2014, hundreds of mining permits held by companies across Indonesia have been annulled as part of an official effort to combat the prevailing state of illegality in the sector. The initiative, and a similar one in the palm oil sector, has been spurred by the nation s anti corruption agency, the KPK. The mayhem in Kendari caught the national spotlight on March 18, when deputy KPK commissioner Laode Syarif tweeted an image showing the extent of the area licensed out to mining firms in Wawonii and in Kabaena, another island in the province. He said the permits not only violate a 2007 law on small islands management but also constitute a crime against the environment and humanity. The environment minister, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, one of several cabinet members tagged in Laode s tweet, replied that she was looking into the matter, but was unfamiliar with the details as her ministry had not issued the permits.

Several years ago, the island broke from Konawe to form a new jurisdiction, Konawe Islands district. As 2019 got underway, however, and the permits were still in place, the demonstrations escalated. On March 4, protesters massed in front of the governor s office and tried to break through a security barricade, before finally retreating and staging a mock die in. Two days later, after marching from Halu Oleo University to the governor s office, they managed to pour into the building s courtyard, prompting police to fire tear gas into the crowd. Some fainted, while others were rushed to hospital. Mostly, they scattered in every direction, unable to open their eyes because of the pain. After the demonstration, a video emerged of the officers chasing down and thrashing a young protester with what appeared to be iron rods. Our friends were beaten by the police like animals, said Mando Maskuri, a field coordinator for the demonstrations.

At the hospital, where she was recovering from exposure to the tear gas, she said she would continue to fight for the permits to be cancelled. This is the consequence of our struggle, she said. We will die a slow death if our land is mined. Better to die at a demonstration in Kendari. The companies with permits to mine on the island include PT Alatoma Karya, PT Bumi Konawe Mining, PT Derawan Berjaya Mining, PT Gema Kreasi Perdana, PT Kimco Citra Mandiri, PT Konawe Bakti Pratama, PT Hasta Karya Megacipta, PT Pasir Berjaya Mining, PT Cipta Puri Sejahtera, PT Natanya Mitra Energy, PT Investa Pratama Inti Karya and PT Kharisman Kreasi Abadi some companies have more than one permit . Officials have previously expressed concern that companies could sue if their permits were annulled, which has happened elsewhere in Indonesia.

      "A state owned plantation company, PTPN XIV, is evicting farmers to make room for an oil palm estate on the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. In 1973, the company got a permit to raise cattle and farm tapioca on the now disputed land, but it expired in 2003. After a long hiatus, the company has returned to claim the land. It says the government has promised to give it permits in the future, but has started operations anyway even as local communities resist. The case is one of thousands of land disputes simmering across Indonesia, as President Joko Widodo attempts to carry out an ambitious land reform program. The president has also ordered a freeze on the issuance of new oil palm plantation permits, but the level of enforcement remains to be seen. MAROANGIN, Indonesia One day in March last year, Rahim was shocked and furious to find an excavator rolling through his rice field, turning the bright green grains into piles of mud. The 51 year old farmer took photos of the incursion and demanded to know why his family s livelihood was being uprooted. Rahim had been farming the land for 15 years, but the workers on the scene said he was trespassing on land that belonged to a company. No company held a license to operate there, much less evict residents, but Rahim didn t know that. Now he was being told that rows of oil palm trees would be planted where his rice was growing. When I can t farm rice, how is my family supposed to eat Rahim said at his home in Maroangin, a village on the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The father of four recalled having cried as he watched the rice, almost ready to harvest, disappear before him. A harvest that size could have supported his family for months. Many of his neighbors also reported having their farms and pastures taken over by the company, state owned PT Perkebunan Nusantara PTPN XIV. Like countless other farmers across Indonesia, Rahim doesn t have a deed to the land he says his family has occupied for generations. That leaves him with scant legal defense to claims laid on it by the state or private companies. Read moreIn Indonesia, a Company Intimidates, Evicts and Plants Oil Palm Without Permits\n",

      "The Thousand Islands regency has decided to suspend sand drilling activities on Kongsi Island, Pari Island subdistrict, following complaints from residents over concerns that construction for the overwater resort project would affect their livelihood. Thousand Island deputy regent Junaedi and local officials visited the construction site on Friday. We checked the site and have temporarily suspended drilling on Kongsi Island, he said on Friday as reported by wartakota.tribunnews.com. He said the decision was made in response to reports from residents who feared that the project would hamper their daily activities as traditional fishermen. Junaedi conceded that the subdistrict head should have known about the sand drilling and informed residents of the area. We will invite the company to discuss its permit. We want to know why they are drilling up to 30 meters deep, he said, claiming that he had not been informed of any plans to build an overwater hotel or restaurant in the area. Yoba, one of the workers of engineering service firm PT Pratama Wiyda, said out of 15 drilling points on Kongsi Island, only four had been completed.

      "Activists in Jakarta and cities around the world staged protests outside Bank of China branches and Chinese diplomatic missions on March 1. They called on state owned BOC to end its funding for a hydroelectric project in Sumatra that threatens the only known habitat of the Tapanuli orangutan, the world s rarest great ape. A lawsuit is pending in an Indonesian court, and a verdict due on March 4 could see the developer s environmental permit rescinded, essentially halting the project. The protests come amid a revelation, first reported by Mongabay, that the signature of a scientist involved in the environmental impact analysis was forged to obtain the permit. JAKARTA Activists in Indonesia and abroad staged a coordinated protest on March 1 to draw attention to a controversial hydroelectric project in Sumatra funded by China that threatens the world s rarest great ape, the Tapanuli orangutan. The activists protested out Chinese diplomatic missions and branches of state owned Bank of China, which is funding the planned dam through loans, in cities including Jakarta, New York, Hong Kong, Manila and Johannesburg. In Indonesia, where the 1.6 billion project is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit, activists from the Indonesian Forum for the Environment Walhi and other NGOs called on BOC to rescind its loans, saying that allowing the project to proceed would devastate the Batang Toru ecosystem, the only known habitat of the Tapanuli orangutan Pongo tapanuliensis . Dwi Sawung, the chief campaigner for energy issues at Walhi, said BOC had acknowledged last May receiving an open letter from Walhi, which called on it to withdraw from the project, and said it would investigate on the matter. But there hasn t been any news from them since then, Dwi told Mongabay at the demonstration in Jakarta. He said that prompted Walhi to stage the latest series of protests and send another open letter to BOC branches and Chinese embassies and consulates. Despite many attempts to convey our concerns since May 2018, we still have not received a meaningful response from Bank of China, the new letter says. If built, the dam will likely doom the newly discovered Tapanuli orangutan species to extinction. Less than 800 of them are left. Walhi also launched an online petition at Change.org to call BOC to stop funding the project. Forest fragmentation The project to build the 510 megawatt hydropower plant has been controversial from the outset because of concerns about its environmental impact. Key among them is the fate of the Tapanuli orangutan, a species only described in 2017, yet already declared critically endangered and the world s rarest great ape. Gabriella Fredriksson, a wildlife biologist with the Sumatran Orangutan Conversation Programme SOCP , said there were so few Tapanuli orangutans that this species can t afford even an offtake of a few individuals. But the project developer, PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy NSHE , says the impact on the ape and its habitat will be minimal. It says building the reservoir for the power plant will flood just 90 hectares 220 acres of its total 6,500 hectare 16,000 acre concession in the Batang Toru ecosystem. The total area taken up by the project, once complete, will be 122 hectares 300 acres , says NHSE spokesman Firman Taufick. William F. Laurance, a professor at James Cook University in Australia who led a major study of the Tapanuli orangutan, said while the area occupied by the dam might not seem all that large, its supporting infrastructure, especially service roads, would still threaten the survival of the orangutans by splitting the already disjointed orangutan populations into smaller and smaller pieces. That would increase the chances of problems like inbreeding, accelerating the species slide toward extinction. The roads will also create openings into previously inaccessible parts of the forest that will be prone to exploitation by farmers and poachers. Using NSHE s logic, someone could cut off your head and there would be only minor damage, because far less than 1 percent of your tissue would be destroyed, Laurance said. Editor s note Laurance is a member of Mongabay s advisory board. Agus Djoko Ismanto, NSHE s senior environmental adviser, said the company planned to minimize the fragmentation problem by building its service roads along riverbanks in Batang Toru. So these roads won t splice up the forest, he said at a media briefing in Jakarta the day before the protests. Questionable study, permit The developer has also called into question the presence of orangutans in its project area, citing a study by a local government agency. The study says orangutans had largely left that part of the forest before construction of the project began because of the spread of farms and settlements in the area. Laurance has rebutted the study, saying that field research by my colleagues in Sumatra has shown their findings to be woefully inaccurate. Fredriksson of the SOCP said her team had carried out an extensive biodiversity study of the hydropower project area in 2015, under contracted by a consultancy, ERM. The nest surveys showed that the lowland area along the Batang Toru River has the highest density of orangutans compared to any of the other locations in the Batang Toru Ecosystem that we have surveyed since 2003, she told Mongabay. Laurance and Fredriksson have also questioned the credibility of Aek Nauli, the government agency that issued the study. Laurance said it was notorious for producing unreliable research to aid industry, while Fredriksson said they have gone commercial on various fronts and are indeed hired by NSHE to counter any data from other sources on the importance of the area for orangutans or other wildlife. NSHE s Firman has rebutted the accusation, saying the company didn t fund the study done by Aek Nauli. Even major development funders such as the World Bank have steered clear of the project because of the environmental concerns. Fredriksson said it might have been her team s findings that spooked them. She said the findings were used by ERM for an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ESIA , a standard widely applied internationally to identify and mitigate impacts of major projects on biodiversity. This report probably scared the World Bank s International Finance Corporation IFC and the Asian Development Bank ADB away, Fredriksson said. NSHE, though, said it had never approached the IFC or the ADB to seek funding for the project. WALHI s Sawung said it was critically important, for a project in such a biodiverse area, to undergo a strict environmental impact assessment before construction. But that doesn t appear to be the case for the locally conducted assessment, known as an Amdal, for which NHSE received its environmental permit to start building. Lawsuit verdict due One of the independent scientists employed to catalog the biodiversity of the ecosystem told Mongabay recently that his findings were omitted from the Amdal submitted to regulators, and that his signature on the document was forged. Onrizal Onrizal, a forestry researcher at North Sumatra University, said he worked on the Amdal in 2013, but that the final version was issued in 2016. He said he wasn t even aware that the 2016 version existed until late last year. The revelation casts doubt on the integrity of the licensing process for a project already mired in controversy. Sawung said he hoped it would be the determining factor in Walhi s lawsuit seeking to revoke the environmental permit for NSHE, which was issued by the North Sumatra provincial government based on the Amdal. Sawung said the only rational outcome would be for the court to rule in Walhi s favor, given that a forged signature would render the Amdal, and by extension the environmental permit, invalid. The court is scheduled to deliver its verdict March 4. Besides the alleged forgery of Onrizal s signature, environmentalists have also questioned the Amdal s omission of eight endangered species from the list of wildlife found in the Batang Toru forest. The previous version compiled by Onrizal listed 23 species, while the final one has 15. Those missing include the Tapanuli orangutan, Sumatran tiger, sun bear, and Sumatran lar gibbon. NSHE s Agus said the list was changed because the location of the project s quarry was also changed in the revised Amdal. As a result, the new document only listed species found in the location of the new quarry. Agus said the company would ensure that no species, whether named on the list or not, would be harmed in the process of building the hydropower plant. Sawung rejected this explanation, saying all species from throughout the project site, and not just the quarry, should have been listed. The whole project entails other infrastructure, not only the quarry, he said. Maybe they limited the scope to just the quarry, but we re talking about a whole ecosystem here.

      "Details Published on Monday, 18 March 2019 14 35 The leader of the Islamic militant group Laskar Jihat, Jafar Umar Thalib JUT , and seven of his followers are under criminal investigation by the Papuan Regional Police. According to police chief Martuani Sormin, the investigation was launched in relation to acts of vandalism on the 27 February 2019. JUT and his men had allegedly damaged several houses in the Muara Tami District of Jayapura Municipality. Local residents reacted angrily, burning tires and blocking roads in response to the incident. The police and the inter religious forum in Jayapura reacted promptly to calm down the protesters in order to avoid an escalations of the conflict. Sormin did not make statements elaborating the involvement of JUT in the incident. JUT moved to the Kerom Regency in 2015, where he started to build an islamic boarding school pesantren and carried out multiple activities promoting the spreading of Islam. The presence of JUT has lead to rejection and anxiety among many people in Kerom and Jayapura. Shortly his arrival in the Kerom Regency, local churches and human rights defenders documented various violent conflicts between Christians and Muslims in the Kerom Regency.\n",
      "On Aug. 24, indigenous people in North Sumatra staged a protest against the development of a planned 510 megawatt hydroelectric dam which threatens to evict them from their ancestral land. The protest turned sour after a woman was knocked over during a scuffle between protestors and people claiming to be representatives of the project s developer, PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy. The project also threatens to damage the ecosystem of the Batang Toru forest, home to Critically Endangered Sumatran tigers and orangutans. Dozens of indigenous people gathered in a village in western Indonesia last month to protest against the development of a planned 510 megawatt hydroelectric dam that threatens to evict them from land they hold sacred. The protest, which took place Aug. 24 in Luat Lombang village of North Sumatra s Sipirok subdistrict, turned sour as violence erupted between locals and people claiming to be land surveyors working for the project s developer, PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy NSHE . Demand and supply With officials estimating that electricity demand will increase by 9 percent per year, Indonesia is in the midst of an intensive drive to increase its energy production. At the same time, the country has declared its intention to increase renewables to 23 percent of the national energy mix by 2025. Geothermal, hydropower, and biofuels are top investment priorities. The vast archipelagic country is estimated to contain up to 26 gigawatts of hydropower potential, according to the 2011 Masterplan Study for Hydropower Development in Indonesia. However, as of 2013, the country had less than 4,100 megawatts of installed hydropower capacity, according to the energy ministry. The hydropower plant in South Tapanuli district, which was announced in 2012, is said to be the largest on Sumatra island and is considered a priority project by the federal government. The development, which is scheduled to be completed 2022, will occupy 645 hectares 2.49 square miles of land along the Batang Toru river in South Tapanuli district. It will involve the construction of a powerhouse, a substation, headrace and tailrace tunnels, a reservoir, spillway and related infrastructure, the installation of turbines, generators and transformers and the laying of transmission lines. The project has met with resistance from indigenous peoples who refuse to sell their lands at the prices the company has offered. It also threatens the habitats of a number of endangered wildlife species. Community members protest On Aug. 24, a small group of representatives of developer PT NSHE, accompanied by local police officers, arrived in Luat Lombang village to survey the land designated for the hydropower plant. The visit was met with a protest staged by some 38 men and women from three neighboring villages Pargodungan, Paske and Dano who attempted to block the path to the project site. If there s still an objection, please submit a lawsuit to the court. What the company s doing right now is based on the law because they ve made payments for the land , said PT NSHE lawyer Syamsul Alam Nasution. The situation heated up when the company s representatives insisted their workers be allowed to carry out the job. In a video of the incident provided by local activists, a man named Syarif, who identified himself as a PT NSHE representative, can be seen telling protestors he is entitled to enter the village Our lawyer said there s no need for a negotiation anymore. I m allowed to take what s rightfully mine. I have paid for the land , I will own it. Violence then erupted after Syarif appeared later in the video to shove one of the protesting women off the path into the bush. During the chaos, another woman claimed that a man, who she says identified himself as a former police general, elbowed her in the abdomen when she refused to leave the protest. The woman, who s been identified as S. Harahap, collapsed and was taken to the Sipirok hospital. It was so painful that I fell, she told Mongabay Indonesia at the hospital. I heard the man claiming to be a former general telling us to leave and that the land is not ours. We held our ground and he elbowed me in the stomach. The incident prompted the protesters to immediately submit a report against the alleged former general to the police. However, the protestors say officers from the Sipirok subdistrict and South Tapanuli police stations refused to receive the complaint. Meanwhile, the North Sumatra police have denied claims of an attack by any officer, adding that the police were only deployed to beef up security during the company s land survey. If there was an assault, it was reportedly committed by a company official, not a police officer, said Senior Commissioner Rina Sari Ginting, the spokeswoman of the North Sumatra police, to Mongabay. She added that the police are investigating the case. Andy S. Harahap, a representative from one of the indigenous communities, said the people regretted the incident, and noted that they were not against infrastructure development as long as they were treated fairly. They inherited these lands from their ancestors. The rice fields and rubber plantations that they ve developed themselves are potentially more profitable than the price that the company has offered, said Harahap. In 2013, for instance, PT NSHE wanted to purchase the lands in three neighborhoods at the price of 6,000 rupiah 0.46 per meter, according to Harahap. The locals rejected the offer. Two weeks later, said Harahap, the company returned and threatened that people who continued to reject the company s offer would have to seek compensation via the courts. According to Harahap, some people got scared and decided to sell their lands at 8,000 rupiah per meter. The following year, he added, the company paid another visit and offered to buy the lands at between 10,000 60,000 rupiah per meter. As of May 2016, the company had acquired 87 percent of the planned 645 hectare site. In 2016 statements to local news website GoSumut.com, officials from PT NSHE emphasized that they have carried out socialization efforts in which the company s officials talk with respected figures from some of the indigenous communities. In addition, the company also claimed to have set up community relations facilitation teams to resolve complaints from the locals. Threats to wildlife The development of the hydropower plant in South Tapanuli district is also predicted to damage the biodiversity of Batang Toru forest, which is home to the Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris ssp. sumatrae and the Sumatran orangutan Pongo abelii , both of which are listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. We must anticipate everything to avoid the destruction of biodiversity there, said Fitri CH Noor, a forestry officer at the North Sumatra Natural Resources Conservation Agency. PT NSHE has pledged to protect the wildlife habitats by establishing within the project site a restricted zone to prevent poachers and illegal loggers from entering. As the project moves forward, we will continue keeping safe the environment, said Arif Siregar of the company s social and environment department, in Aug. 2016.

      "Thousands of Muslims gather in Jakarta to pray for Indonesia Jakarta ANTARA News Thousands of Muslim worshipers gathered in the National Monument Monas Square here on Thursday evening to seek the mercy of almighty Allah Subhanahu Wata ala for Indonesia ahead of this year s general elections. They came from Jakarta and other cities to attend the event, which was organized by the Indonesian Ulema Council MUI Jakarta Chapter along with several other Islamic organizations, by highlighting the theme of 212 Evening of Prayer. The Muslim men and women flocked to the Monas Square in Central Jakarta a few hours before the Maghrib prayer was performed in congregation. With the guidance of ulemas sitting on a stage, the crowd started the event s agenda by performing compulsory Maghrib sunset followed by Isha evening prayers in congregation, as well as chanting praises to Allah. They also recited and sang Shalawat religious chants for praising Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him in an endeavor to knock the gates of sky. This religious gathering was also filled with prayer for the safety of Habib Rizieq Shihab. Shihab is widely known as a respected ulema and the founder of the Islamic Defenders Front FPI . He is currently staying in the Holy city of Mecca with his family, and the crowds of attendees prayed for his return to Indonesia. The gathering was not only attended by ordinary Muslim worshipers but also by many influential figures in the country, including Amien Rais one of the Reform Movement leaders , Fahri Hamzah, and Fadli Zon outspoken legislators . Speaker of the People s Consultative Assembly MPR Zulkifli Hasan, MPR s former speaker Hidayat Nur Wahid, FPI leader Sobri Lubis, and the daughter of Indonesia s second president Soeharto, Titiek Soeharto were also seen among the attendees. In his brief speech, Lubis asked the crowd to pray for the safety of several Muslim figures who remained in prison, including Buni Yani and Ahmad Dhani. He also criticized what he called an act of injustice in law enforcement, as observed in the Habib Bahar bin Smith case. Meanwhile, MPR Speaker Zulkifli Hasan underlined the importance of conducting fair, peaceful, and democratic parliamentary and presidential elections for Indonesia s better future. In securing the gathering, at least 12 thousand security personnel were deployed. They consisted of those from the Jakarta Metropolitan Police, Indonesian Military, and the Jakarta Provincial Government. Reporting by Fianda Sjofjan Rassat and Rahmad Nasution\n",
      "The organizers of the 212 Munajat prayer have denied that journalists covering the event were assaulted by event participants, claiming the incidents were incidental and that organizers not had directed people to act in a hostile manner toward journalists. At the event held at the National Monument Monas on Thursday evening, several journalists were reportedly intimidated and assaulted by event participants including 212 members and members of the Islam Defenders Front FPI . The alleged incidents were reportedly triggered by the search for a pickpocket. The organizers regretted that the commotion caused by pickpockets and provocateurs had stained the event, the event leader Idrus al Habsyi said. He said the alleged violence against journalists was incidental and was not part of the standard operating procedures set by the organizers or the LPI, which was assigned as the security team. There was no order to act firmly toward journalists, Idrus said in a statement made available to The Jakarta Post, adding that the alleged violence experienced by the journalists might have been an unintended consequence of the emotion driven volunteers' efforts to catch the pickpocket. He added that the organizers had observed that there had been concerted efforts to blow up the incident to divert attention away from the success of the prayer gathering. The event was solemn and peaceful, where ummah Islamic society members were knocking on the sky s door, pouring their heart out to God, he said. Read also Tape the good side, not the bad side Journalists intimidated, assaulted while covering 212 prayer The accusations of journalist intimidation were part of a systematic attempt by the anti Islamic movement to label and frame the organizers as violent, he added. The Jakarta Chapter of the Alliance of Independent Journalists AJI has condemned the alleged incident and reported that a journalist, Satria Kusuma, with Detik.com was targeted by a crowd of people who had secured him in a VIP tent. In the tent, he was allegedly beaten, scratched and forced to squat in front of dozens of people. His cellphone was allegedly seized and all his photos and videos deleted. They also uninstalled the WhatsApp messaging app to prevent him from contacting people. A journalist from CNN named Joni Aswira was also reportedly scolded by a crowd of people who asked him the name of the media organization he worked for. We believe their deleting of videos and photos from these journalists' cameras is illegal. They have hampered journalists' efforts to fulfill the public s right to information, Asnil Bambang Amri, head of AJI Jakarta, and Erick Tanjung, head of AJI Jakarta Advocation, said in a statement. They cited the 1999 Press Freedom Law, which provides legal protection for journalists to report news to the public. The law also stipulates that violators could be punished by two years imprisonment or a Rp 500 million US 35,543.25 fine. The case was reported to the Central Jakarta Police just after midnight on Friday. Central Jakarta Police spokesperson Adj. Comr. Purwadi said the case was now under investigation. The reported case is of collective violence toward a person or object in public, he told The Jakarta Post on Friday. If apprehended, the suspects could face charges under Article 170 of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum punishment of five years and six months imprisonment. The 212 movement is linked to the massive sectarian rally on Dec. 2, 2016, that called for prosecution of then Jakarta governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy. ggq\n",
      "Police are searching for seven suspects connected to the mob killing of two men at Medan State University in North Sumatra Unimed , following the arrest of four security guards. It is believed that some of the suspects are university students, according to Medan Police criminal unit chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Putu Yudha Prawira. Some are at large. We re searching for them all, including some students who were involved in the beating, he said Monday. Investigators identified the seven suspects through their questioning of four arrested security guards, namely M. Arya Prasta, 22, Bagus Prayetno, 18, M. Abdul Kadir, 21 and Feri Zulham, 26. We have questioned them, and they confessed to the beating, he added. The four are accused of beating Jhony Fernando Silalahi, Arya Prasta and Steven Sihombing after dragging them from the university s gate to a security post. One victim died at the post and another died en route to Medan Haj Hospital, Putu said. On Feb. 19, Jhony and Steven, residents of Siodorejo subdistrict in Medan Tembung district, Medan, entered the Unimed complex on a motorcycle. Later, they were accused of stealing the helmets of two people who had reported the theft to campus security. As Jhony and Steven were leaving the campus, they were allegedly stopped by security guards and told to produce a vehicle registration document STNK , which they did not have. The security guards reportedly tried to open their motorcycle s storage compartment under the seat to look for the stolen helmets, but Jhony and Steven refused to comply. They were then allegedly handcuffed and beating. A video of the beating went viral last week. Percut Seituan Police chief Comr. Faidil Zikri has said that investigators had questioned several witnesses in the case, including the students whose helmets were allegedly stolen. The four suspects have been charged under articles 170 and 351 of the Criminal Code on aggravated assault that led to death. Combined, the maximum punishment is 13 years imprisonment. The families of the two deceased victims have demanded that police thoroughly investigate the case. Jhony was not a thief. The motorbike he rode belonged to his in laws, Jhony s cousin, Sutan Silalahi, told The Jakarta Post at his residence in Medan Tembung district last week. He added that Jhony s death was a huge blow to the family. Jhony was an onion trader at MMTC, Sutan said. When Jhony was unable to leave Unimed because he did not have his vehicle motorcycle s STNK, he called his pregnant wife and asked her to bring his vehicle ownership document BPKB to the campus instead because the STNK was with his in laws in Penang, Malaysia. Before his wife could arrive, he was beaten by a mob and died, Sutan said. Percut Seituan Police investigation and crime unit chief First Insp. MK Daulay said they had received a report from victims families. The police also received a report from the two university students whose helmets were allegedly stolen, Daulay said. swa\n",
      "Robi Alhalim, an Islamic boarding school student at Pondok Pesantren Nurul Ikhlas in the West Sumatra city of Padang Panjang, died yesterday morning after he was allegedly beaten by his fellow students. He was in a coma for more than a week in a hospital in the province s capital of Padang before succumbing to his injuries. According to the local police, students at the school accused Robi of theft because they believed he was responsible for numerous items going missing at the dorm recently. Nineteen students then allegedly abused him at the dorm over three days, after which he was hospitalized before, tragically, passing away from his injuries. The Padang Panjang Police say they are still investigating the case and that they have seized some evidence pertaining to Robi s suspected murder during a raid conducted last night. We have seized some evidence, such as a broken broom stick and shoes allegedly used to beat up the victim, and the victim s clothes, Padang Panjang Police s Crime Investigation Unit Chief Kalbert Jonaidi told Detik today. We re still investigating whether the victim really took his friends belongings or whether there were any other motives. Police have charged 17 of the students as murder suspects, but, due to their ages, they are being investigated in accordance to the country s Child Protection Laws. Two others, also believed to be involved in Robi s beatings, are still being treated as witnesses. None of the suspects are in police custody thus far. Investigators have also questioned five witnesses from the boarding school, including the ustadz preachers , the dorm head, and school supervisors to determine whether or not there was any negligence on their part.\n",

Protests against Valentine's day are not uncommen in Indonesia. The day is generally seen as un Islamic, not only for its connotations of sex and foreign influence, but also because Muslims are discouraged from celebrating non traditional holidays. The teenagers held posters saying Sorry Valentine's Day, I am Muslim, and chanted Say no to Valentine's now Their school principal had warned that exchanging gifts on Valentines day can quickly lead to sin. We want to remind our young generation not to be caught up in Western culture, he told AFP. Indonesian authorities carried out raids in Surabaya and Makassar city on Sulawesi island to clamp down on any celebrations. A prohibition was issued against the day in the conservative Aceh province where Islamic law is implemented and people can be publicly whipped for selling alcohol amongst other offences. Although this represents a growing Islamic influence in the country, many Indonesians are not averse to celebrating the day and exchanged flowers and chocolates to show their affection.\n",

      "More than 100 protestors took to the streets just outside Jakarta to protest against the proposed music law Indonesian entertainers have rallied against a draft law that seeks to ban blasphemous and pornographic music content, which critics say could be used to clamp down on freedom of expression in the Muslim majority nation. More than 100 protestors many carrying placards or playing guitars and drums took to the streets of Bogor, near Jakarta, on Sunday to demonstrate against the proposed law. An online appeal calling for the vaguely worded bill to be scrapped has been signed by nearly 270,000 people. Under the proposed law, musicians would be prevented from bringing negative influences from foreign cultures and or degrading human dignity in Indonesia. As well as cracking down on blasphemous and pornographic content, it imposes onerous new requirements on musicians, such as carrying out competency tests to gain certification. The legislation, which is being considered by parliament, could see musicians jailed or fined for failing to comply. Artists say the vague wording of the draft law could lead to misuse by authorities. Danilla Riyadi, who initiated the petition on behalf of a coalition of concerned musicians, said the bill is very dangerous and could be the gateway for a group of people to persecute the creative process of people they dislike. Musician turned politician Anang Hermansyah, who is on the committee that drew up the bill, has been quoted as saying the goal was to strengthen Indonesia's entertainment industry and that the details could still be changed. It is not clear why the bill suggests banning foreign influences and pornographic content or what would be classified as pornographic content in music. Almost 90 percent of Indonesia's more than 260 million people identify as Muslim but the vast majority practise a moderate form of the religion. However, foreign artists have occasionally found themselves in the cross hairs of religious conservatives or fallen afoul of the country's censors. Pop star Lady Gaga cancelled a concert in 2012 because of security concerns after Islamist hardliners promised chaos if she entered Indonesia.

      "Former residents of Lebak Bulus in South Jakarta staged a protest in front of the MRT depot on Jan. 30, demanding to be compensated for their land. Dozens of Lebak Bulus residents who used to live near Lebak Bulus Stadium on Jl. RA Kartini in South Jakarta held a protest in front of the MRT train depot on Wednesday, demanding the city administration to compensate them for their land, on which the train depot currently stands. Protester Audy Walangitan, 54, said 16 plots of land belonging to 14 families had been used for MRT infrastructure. The city had promised to pay them Rp 20.3 million US 1,400 per meter, she said. They used 3,500 square meters in total. We haven t received the compensation, Audy said as reported by wartakota.tribunnews.com. Most of us had lived here for more than 40 years. Some even owned the land legally and paid taxes for it, she added, noting that residents wanted the money before the MRT was scheduled to be launched in March. Audy conceded that most of their ownership documents had been submitted to the Lebak Bulus subdistrict office on March 23, 2011, for the compensation process. This was before construction of the MRT station started. Three years after they agreed to give up their land, the MRT project began. In February 2015, we asked the subdistrict office. They said that our documents have been transferred to the municipality administration. The municipality said that our land was part of the Lebak Bulus Stadium, she explained.

      "Hundreds of students of a state junior high school in Wonogiri, Central Java, staged a rally on Monday to demand an English teacher not be allowed to continue working over accusations that he sexually harassed a female student. The protest was the second in a week held by the students to show support for the alleged victim. The first took place on Saturday in Slogohimo district, Wonogiri. The students accused the teacher, identified only as HM, of groping a female student s breast in front of other students, reportedly as punishment for not doing her homework. So there were many students who saw it, prompting students to stage the rally, said a student who asked for anonymity. Following the protest on Saturday, the school s acting headmaster Martono promised the students that management would demand an explanation from the teacher in question. Martono also told the students that if management found any indication the incident had taken place, the school would suspend the teacher to allow the school to investigate further. As of now we have yet to receive any clarification, but the students have already conducted another the protest, Martono said on Monday. Everything needs to be checked first, starting with the teacher, the student and the witnesses. Without clarification, it is impossible for the school to punish him. The school management has reported the case to the Wonogiri Education and Culture Agency, but Martono said the school would first try to handle the case internally. We will settle the case here first. I will ask for written reports on the case from the accused teacher, students and other teachers, he said. As for the students demand, Martono said he does not have the authority to dismiss the accused teacher or ban him from teaching at the school. It s under the authority of the agency. I have informed them about this allegation, Martono said. The Wonogiri Education and Culture Agency s teacher division head, Retno Puspitorini, said that her office has already set up a team to investigate HM. We will start the examination on Tuesday, said Retno, adding that the accused teacher would be summoned to the agency s office, along with the victim. Slogohimo Police chief Adj. Comr. Kukuh Wiyono said he was aware of the student demonstrations, but the force had not yet started an investigation into the alleged assault because no report had been filed with the police, either by the victim or her family.

The protest was the second in a week held by the students to show support for the alleged victim. The first took place on Saturday in Slogohimo district, Wonogiri. The students accused the teacher, identified only as HM, of groping a female student s breast in front of other students, reportedly as punishment for not doing her homework. So there were many students who saw it, prompting students to stage the rally, said a student who asked for anonymity. Following the protest on Saturday, the school s acting headmaster Martono promised the students that management would demand an explanation from the teacher in question. Martono also told the students that if management found any indication the incident had taken place, the school would suspend the teacher to allow the school to investigate further. As of now we have yet to receive any clarification, but the students have already conducted another the protest, Martono said on Monday. Everything needs to be checked first, starting with the teacher, the student and the witnesses. Without clarification, it is impossible for the school to punish him. The school management has reported the case to the Wonogiri Education and Culture Agency, but Martono said the school would first try to handle the case internally. We will settle the case here first. I will ask for written reports on the case from the accused teacher, students and other teachers, he said. As for the students demand, Martono said he does not have the authority to dismiss the accused teacher or ban him from teaching at the school. It s under the authority of the agency. I have informed them about this allegation, Martono said. The Wonogiri Education and Culture Agency s teacher division head, Retno Puspitorini, said that her office has already set up a team to investigate HM. We will start the examination on Tuesday, said Retno, adding that the accused teacher would be summoned to the agency s office, along with the victim. Slogohimo Police chief Adj. Comr. Kukuh Wiyono said he was aware of the student demonstrations, but the force had not yet started an investigation into the alleged assault because no report had been filed with the police, either by the victim or her family. It s the nature of such a case that the police can only launch an investigation if there is a complaint, he said. ipa\n",
      "A human rights group has condemned the banning of a protest by Jayapura Police in Papua on Thursday. The so called kamisan is a peaceful, silent protest held every Thursday to call on the government to resolve cases of past human rights abuses. The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence Kontras said the ban reflected the state s repression of the freedom of expression. We warn the police that every citizen s right to express their opinion is guaranteed by the Constitution, Kontras coordinator Yati Andriyani said, citing Article 28E of the Constitution and the 2005 law on the international covenant of civil rights. She added that the police s decision to ban the kamisan also contradicted the government s promise to resolve cases of right abuses in Papua, such as the Wamena case of 2001 and the Wasior case of 2003 by the police and the military, as well as the December 2014 shooting by security forces in Paniai that killed four Papuan students. The kamisan usually takes place in front of Merdeka Palace and is occassionally attended by noted figures, including Catholic priest and philosopher Franz Magnis Suseno. Kontras pushed the government and all stakeholders to show more concern for the protest and protect the people s freedom of expression. That includes to guarantee that people in Papua can hold the kamisan safely, Yati said. The commission also called on the National Commission on Human Rights Komnas HAM and the National Police Commission Kompolnas to immediately evaluate the Papua Police chief s actions and to refrain from issuing any policies that would restrict peaceful protests. Yati also demanded that President Joko Jokowi Widodo use his authority to ensure that all police forces, including those in Papua, upheld principals of human rights and democracy and instruct the National Police to protect people who participate in protests. The police have yet to comment on the ban.\n",

Photo Twitter Veronica Koman Since late last year, a large joint military and police operation has been underway in the Highlands region in pursuit of the West Papua Liberation Army. The crackdown is a response to the killings of at least 16 Indonesian road construction workers and a soldier in early December, which the Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for. The armed group accused the workers of being Indonesian military spies, a claim rejected by Indonesia's military TNI .

      "Twelve prisoners were moved from a Class I prison in Surakarta, Central Java, on Thursday, following a riot involving visitors and inmates. The riot began on Thursday morning after 20 people visited an inmate, identified as Ikhsan, a member of a mass organization who had been convicted for possession of an offensive weapon. Prison officials said that Ikhsan had been involved in a dispute with other inmates over a card game. While they were leaving the prison, the visitors shouted out Allahu Akbar God is great in an apparent taunt at the inmates with whom Ikhsan had been in dispute in Block C1, who responded by making animal like noises. The visitors then told other members of the mass organization that Ikhsan had been mistreated by his fellow inmates, which caused hundreds of people to rush the prison doors in an attempt to get in. At the same time, a group of inmates went to Block C1 and the two groups of inmates started throwing rocks at each other. Hundreds of police and Indonesian Military TNI personnel were deployed to quell the riot and the crowd was eventually dispersed. As of this afternoon the atmosphere is calm and conducive. The incident was merely the result of a misunderstanding between prisoners, Surakarta Class I prison warden Muhammad Ulin Nuha said. To prevent the heightening of tensions, we removed the inmates who were involved in the riot to Sragen and Kedung Pane Semarang, he continued. In total we moved 12 inmates. Deputy Surakarta Police chief Andi Rifai confirmed that a riot occurred but that the situation had been brought under control. Everything has been suppressed, the situation is now normal and peaceful, Andi said. People need not be concerned. Surakarta is safe. kmt\n",
      "Supporters of Palang Pracharath Party attend their last party campaign rally outside a stadium in central Bangkok March 22, 2019. Reuters pic BANGKOK, March 31 Thai demonstrators today protested against alleged cheating in the junta ruled kingdom s first election since a 2014 coup, a week after the controversial poll sowed confusion over the ballot results. A military backed party and its main rival led by a self exiled billionaire have both claimed the right to lead the government as inconsistent tallies released by the Election Commission have raised suspicion among voters. The junta aligned Phalang Pracharat party clinched the popular vote but its rival Pheu Thai linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra has formed a coalition claiming a majority of seats in the lower house. Full results will be ratified by May 9 but anger has mounted as the wait continues, prompting demonstrations at two Bangkok landmarks. A small but spirited group gathered near the tourist hotspot Erawan Shrine holding a banner that read Cheating Election and People Want to Vote . It featured the face of 2014 coup leader Prayut Chan O Cha, who is standing as the prime ministerial candidate for Phalang Pracharat. It is the Pheu Thai party which won the election, organiser and activist Anurak Jeantawanich said. Demonstrators were collecting signatures for a petition to demand the dismissal of Election Commission members, who have conceded some errors in tabulation but stand by the latest figures. Other protesters huddled near Bangkok s Victory Monument. With parliamentary seats yet to be confirmed, both sides are engaged in a furious bout of horsetrading to convince smaller non aligned parties to join them. But the overall math favours the junta under rules it wrote. The senate or upper house will be made up of 250 military appointed members who get to cast votes for prime minister. That means the anti junta parties need 376 lawmakers more than half the seats in the lower house to override that advantage and pick their own candidate. Analysts are predicting a deadlock scenario where Prayut is leader but Pheu Thai commands a lower house majority. Parties affiliated with billionaire ex premier Thaksin have won every election since 2001, but this election saw new faces emerge in Thailand s fractious political landscape. Millennial oriented newcomer Future Forward finished third in the popular vote and has joined the coalition with Pheu Thai. AFP\n",
      "Tens of thousands of students across the country walked out of their classrooms Wednesday and onto athletic fields and city streets as part of a massive national protest on gun violence spurred by a Florida high school shooting a month ago that left 17 dead. The walkouts, which came 10 days before a march on Washington that could draw hundreds of thousands of students to the nation s capital, are unprecedented in recent American history, not seen in size or scope since student protests of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s. Supporters say the walkouts and demonstrations represent a realization of power and influence by young people raised on social media who have come of age in an era of never ending wars, highly publicized mass shootings and virulent national politics. The protests unfolded in major cities across the country New York, Washington, Chicago, Seattle and hundreds of smaller towns and communities as well. In Maryland, students held pictures of the victims. At Columbine High in Colorado, the site 19 years ago of one of the first mass school shootings, students filed solemnly onto a soccer field and sent aloft balloons in memory of the victims there and in Florida. And at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, where 14 students and three staff members were killed Feb. 14, students who were supposed to gather on the football field for 17 minutes and then go back to their classrooms, started walking and kept walking to a park. Students involved in the protests have been outspoken about their frustration with adults and political leaders who they believe have made them less safe by not doing more to curb gun violence or address school safety and mental health issues. Many of the participants said the focus on gun control was not an expression of party preference. What they are demanding from Republicans and Democrats alike is action on an issue they believe has been put aside by lawmakers for too long. In an election year, with every seat in the House and a third of the Senate up for votes, the students are determined to make an impact. We want our Congress to know that some of us will be old enough to vote in the midterm elections, and the rest of us are going to be able to vote in 2020 or 2022, and they re going to lose their job if they don t do what we want to keep us safe, said Fatima Younis, a student organizer with Women s March Youth Empower, one of the lead coordinators of Wednesday s walkouts. The group is demanding that lawmakers increase the age for people to purchase weapons, ban military style weapons and demilitarize police forces. Most of the student protests were approved by, and often coordinated with, school administrators. But there were reports of some schools where students were not allowed to hold protests or were penalized if they did. In Washington, politicians and administration officials heard Wednesday s message up close. Hundreds of high school and middle school students from local districts gathered at the White House carrying signs protesting gun violence and those who oppose gun control measures. Just before 10 a.m., the crowd fell silent and sat down on Pennsylvania Avenue, their backs to the White House, with fists and signs held high. They sat quietly, one minute for each of the Stoneman Douglas victims. As the silence was broken at 10 17, the crowd began chanting, We want change In the District s Capitol Hill neighborhood, students pushed through the doors at Stuart Hobson Middle School, past the stone columns and into the streets, singing, The power of one, hoodies pulled up to ward off the cold. They held aloft homemade signs with slogans such as My safety. Your safety, as police motorcycles stopped traffic to let them cross busy streets. Hey hey, ho ho Gun violence has got to go they chanted as they walked quickly to the Capitol grounds. People stepped out of nearby buildings and clapped and cheered as they walked past. At the Capitol, many protesting students heard from lawmakers at an impromptu rally. I look at the crowd and I see the future, and I see you, and I came here to say thank you, Rep. Luis Gutierrez D Ill. said before leading the crowd in a Si, se puede chant, the Spanish phrase for Yes, we can. Because I know you will accomplish what I and others have failed to do. At demonstrations across the country, in blue states and red states, the outpouring by students was an expression of grief and solidarity with schools and families that have experienced shooting deaths as well as a fierce warning to politicians to act. At Columbine High, where shooters killed 12 students and one teacher in 1999, Myriah Murren, 14, told her mother I love you as she was dropped off before sunrise Wednesday. The freshman said she planned to walk out of class later in the morning to send a message to students who survived the shooting in Florida that she and her classmates care for them. A lot of people will join in, she said, adding that going to a school that was the site of one of the earliest mass school shootings makes her and her classmates more aware of the issue. At Minnetonka High School, southwest of Minneapolis St. Paul, students walked out of classes on a cold late winter morning saying they want politicians to take up their cause, even if they have to show them the way. We re tired of sitting around and listening to politicians tell us what they are going to do without ever actually doing anything. And we re also just kind of tired of adults not making it happen adults saying what they are going to do and then just entirely blowing us off, said Dominic Barry, 16, a sophomore at the school. We re the next generation for all these issues and we want people to know that we re not going to sit around and let other people not take action on these issues. Students at Eastern High in Northeast Washington walked out of school into frigid temperatures. They poured onto the field carrying signs honoring the victims of Parkland, and surrounded their school s track. While the school choir sang Lean on Me over the loudspeakers, students released 17 balloons for each of the 17 Parkland victims. Two students said each of their names aloud, then recognized the D.C. residents who lose their lives to gun violence each year. Betty Luther, 16, said she knew something needed to change long before Parkland. The D.C. resident has lost family members and friends still in their teens to gun violence. But this is the first time she has protested, the first time she has locked arms with her classmates to show adults that they are demanding an end to the violence that has been so pervasive in her life. All I could think about is that it just has to stop, said Luther, who was one of 17 students to hold an orange balloon during the walk out. The national walkouts faced a small number of counterprotests. Ethan Schmerer and Porter Kindall, students at Nampa High School in Nampa, Idaho, said the walkout promotes gun control, a stance they oppose. We care about this issue because we want to defend our rights and let our voice be heard, Schmerer told the Idaho Press Tribune last week. While hundreds of Nampa students took part in Wednesday s protest, about 50 joined the counterprotest, the the Idaho Press Tribune reported. At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, still recovering from a violent white supremacist rally last summer, about 2,000 students gathered on the Lawn, many wiping away tears as the names of the 17 Florida victims were read aloud. The university s chapel bells tolled 17 times as students bowed their heads in silence. Parker Dymond, a freshman at St. Andrew s Episcopal School in Potomac, Md., said after every school shooting, the students at the school observe a moment of silence. It has become such a frequent occurrence, said Dymond, 15, that it no longer felt like enough. So Dymond and a handful of other St. Andrew s students skipped school Wednesday to protest in front of the White House and on the Capitol lawn and call for action on gun control. Our school had a coming together instead of a walkout, Dymond said. But that felt disrespectful to me, to honor the victims but ignoring the reason they died. Everything about this is political, added Devin Lucas, 17, a junior at St. Andrew s. The response by students to the school shooting in Florida is different, Younis said, because people thought we were too young to do anything, but students have just had enough. This shooting resonates with people because it could happen to any of us. At Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, several hundred students walked out of class at 9 45 a.m. for a solemn 17 minute demonstration to honor the Florida shooting victims. They sat silently in the school bus drop off zone on a bright, breezy morning as names of those shot and killed were read aloud one by one. For each name on the roll call, one Whitman student stood up. These 17 designated students all wore orange T shirts. Each held a sign with a victim s name and picture, and each clutched an orange helium balloon. At the end of the ceremony, they released the balloons into the blue sky. Every time I looked at her face, I thought, That could have been me, said Beverly Dempsey, 17, a Whitman senior. She stood for Gina Montalto, 14, who died at Stoneman Douglas a month ago. President Trump and lawmakers are noting the role that students are playing in shaping the discussion on guns. The White House announced Sunday it is establishing a Federal Commission on School Safety to be headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. When Florida Gov. Rick Scott R signed a gun bill Friday that raises the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21, he said, To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn t let up and you fought until there was change. Sen. Chris Van Hollen D Md. told students on Capitol Hill he will help them vanquish opponents of changes to gun laws, including the National Rifle Association. We need to make sure that every member of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, people of all political stripes, are more afraid of the next school massacre, more afraid of the next death on our streets, more afraid of that, than they are of the NRA, Van Hollen said. Let s go get them. Rep. Susan Davis D Calif. posted on Twitter that she walked out of Congress in solidarity with students in San Diego across the nation calling for action to prevent gun violence. Just try to keep calm How Parkland students used social media to survive the shooting and then to find their own voice At Cactus Shadows High School in Cave Creek, Ariz., a 40 minute drive north of Phoenix, hundreds of students poured out of classrooms just before 10 a.m. Gabe Ozaki, a 16 year old junior, addressed his schoolmates first, saying, Every person who has ever died in a school shooting started their day like we did today. He went on to say that he thinks America is being robbed of its youth, but that he and others are energized by a wave of activism. All but three of those who were killed at Stoneman Douglas were teenagers. For many of their peers, the list of their names and ages is a depressing reminder of the years stolen from them. Alyssa Alhadeff, 14. Scott Beigel, 35. Martin Duque, 14. Nicholas Dworet, 17. Aaron Feis, 37. Jaime Guttenberg, 14. Chris Hixon, 49. Luke Hoyer, 15. Cara Loughran, 14. Gina Montalto, 14. Joaquin Oliver, 17. Alaina Petty, 14. Meadow Pollack, 18. Helena Ramsay, 17. Alex Schachter, 14. Carmen Schentrup, 16. Peter Wang, 15. At George C. Marshall High School in Falls Church, several hundred students stood in the parking lot, their heads bowed in silence as the names of each of the victims in Parkland were read over a loudspeaker, one name per minute. Several students were in tears by the end, sharing hugs and vowing to keep fighting to keep schools safe from gun violence. It s not so much the names, as the ages, Ella Tynch, 16, said. Maddie Salunga and two of her friends at the District s Stuart Hobson Middle School had been organizing for a month, selling homemade pins after school to raise money for Sandy Hook Promise, which aims to mobilize parents and schools to fight for stricter gun laws and to introduce gun violence prevention programs. They made signs and wrote speeches, too. When they got close enough to see the dome of the Capitol, the whole group dashed toward it, as though playing tag, laughing. But when the students stopped near the steps of the Capitol and passed around a megaphone, the group grew quiet, listening. Some students were angry that adults were unwilling or unable to prevent tragedies. They talked about dead bodies and students hiding under desks and parents whose children never came home. Many said they were scared. One girl burst into tears as she told the group she is afraid every single day at school. That is not okay, she sobbed, as other students nodded. That is not okay. Samara Winston, 12, couldn t understand why her generation is growing up with so much worry. Kids just want to be happy. We just want to play. But here they were, talking about blood and guns. A man stopped at the edge of the crowd to listen. He told them he had graduated from Stoneman Douglas. He told them about driving to a funeral last month, and passing three others along the way. My generation did nothing, Larry Vignola said. I m really proud of your generation, he said. He thanked them for speaking out. At Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy in Connecticut, high school students walked across the campus carrying poster size pictures of the Parkland victims. Student organizers read each name and a brief biography before observing a moment of silence. What started out as a remembrance turned decidedly political as students demanded Washington impose tougher gun laws to end school violence. We will not allow our elected officials to just tweet their thoughts and condolences without any gun reform, said Larnee Satchell, 17, a senior at Hartford Magnet. We need Congress to enact a resolution declaring gun violence a public health crisis. We need Congress to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. We need Congress to expand background checks to all gun sales. Satchell was among several students at Hartford Magnet who worked with administrators to devise a plan for a peaceful demonstration. Principal Sally Biggs said district leaders encouraged schools to support students in their efforts to protest gun violence, but keep them on campus where they could remain safe. Several state and city leaders were on hand Wednesday to support the student demonstration. Our vision is for our students to be able to transform their world. This, today, is our vision in action, Hartford Superintendent Leslie Torres Rodriguez said Wednesday at Hartford Magnet. We have to ensure that we create opportunities academically, socially and civically for our students to be critical thinkers, to look at a problem critically, assess the information and determine a solution. A week after the shooting, Alexa Marotta, 18, a junior and a student representative on the Hartford Board of Education, helped organize small group assemblies on safety protocols at Hartford Magnet. Those meetings evolved into planning sessions for the walkout, in which administrators encouraged students to create an event with purpose, Biggs said. Students, she said, created lesson plans with topics on gun violence and school safety inspired by the Sandy Hook Promise, a planning guide for teachers that emerged after the 2012 shooting at the elementary school in Connecticut. Organizers said it was important to acknowledge Sandy Hook in recognition of the devastation gun violence has wrought in the state. It s sad and terrifying that people think violence is the solution, Marotta said. It s also tragic that those in need of help are often shunned by society before turning to violence. Everyone deserves better. At Nathan Hale High in Tulsa, about 200 students streamed out of school buildings and onto the football field, some holding signs and chanting, Put the guns down The students universally said they want to feel safer at school, but had different ideas of how to achieve that. The school has armed police officers patrolling the hallways, but after a spate of bomb threats this month, many students said they wanted to see metal detectors and bag checks. Earlier this month, students evacuated to the football field after a bomb threat. At the same time, there was a shooting at an apartment complex adjacent to the school. The sound of the shots that day sent the students running back inside the high school, where they went into lockdown mode. Freshman MaKayla Woodard said what happened in Parkland weighed heavily on her and made her anxious to go to school. I m walking out because they weren t safe and we aren t, either, the 14 year old said. The teen, whose father hunts, said she wants to see stricter background checks and mental health screenings for those seeking to buy guns. And she opposes President Trump s proposal to arm teachers, saying she worries that a police officer will mistake an armed black teacher for an aggressor. If a cop sees a black teacher with a gun, that teacher will get shot, she said. Adrian Gastelum, a 17 year old junior, said he also wants to see stricter security. But as a gun owner, he does not believe stricter gun laws are necessary. 7,000 pairs of shoes on Capitol lawn show toll of gun violence In the District, 9 year old Celeste Roselli was in her hotel room when chants from below began leaking through the window. Roselli, a third grader from Atlanta, looked out and saw the street packed with students carrying signs. I wanted to be a part of it, she said. Because I believe we don t just have a right to an education. We have a right to a safe education. She printed a sign from the hotel business center, drew a no guns symbol on it and joined the throng with her grandmother, Karen Richardson, 68, a retired social worker, in tow. Everyone here is incredible and brave, Roselli said. Some of these students were told not to come or threatened, and they re still here. Amelie Gerber, 14, was in elementary school when 20 young students were killed in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. She said she remembers going to school the next day, feeling unsafe for the first time. On Wednesday, Gerber held a sign listing many of the major school shootings from the past two decades. This isn t new. It s been happening since before I was born, she said. Enough is enough. Nick Anderson in Bethesda Moriah Balingit in Tulsa, Okla. Donna Bryson in Columbine, Colo.

      "They were not charged but sent back to their campsite near Wat Benchamabophit a few blocks away. Some 20 representatives led by P Move, campaigning for forestry community rights and forest dwellers rights, had demanded participation in the NLA s deliberation. They were allowed to observe the event for around 15 minutes. Without being able to do anything about the bill, they made loud noises after leaving the chamber but insited to stay around at the compound. The police said they urged the activists to stop, but they refused, so they were ejected. P Move led the forest residents representative to Bangkok in late February. They have been camping around the temple in an attempt to influence decision makers on the bill and some few others, which the group claimed would restrict community rights. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation bills were under discussion. The group feared that the bills would further restrict their rights of access to the forest and the resources in the forest. The National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department had attempted to explain to the protesters, assuring them that forest dwellers could still access forest resources, but under the new conditions set. The bills are part of major amendments to the old acts on national parks and wildlife conservation which do not address how to live in the forest for residents who have overlapping claims with the state. Under the new bills, conditions are due to be introduced to resolve the issue, but with some limitations set, including a limited residency of 20 years. Some penalties to be imposed under the new bills are also seen as too harsh and further threaten residents, the protesters claimed. Prayong Doklamyai, P Move leader, told the Nation the group has not yet decided on the next move as the deliberation on the bills continued throughout the afternoon despite their strong opposition.\n",
      "The new law aims to regulate and raise the standard of security service companies and security guards to ensure increased public safety. It requires a security guard to be a Thai national, age over 18, not addicted to alcohol or drugs and never convicted of a sex charge. Guards much also obtain a licence to work, which will be valid for three years and extendable after an assessment of their past performance. The demonstrators held protest signs that declared many of them would be out of work under the new law, as they had not yet been able to obtain work licences. If the guards work without meeting the requirements, they could face a charge of serving as a security guard without permission, punishable by up to three months in jail and or a maximum Bt5,000 in fine. Their employers could face the charge of hiring unlicensed guards, punishable by up to six months in jail and or a maximum Bt10,000 fine. Under this law, the owners of security guard businesses are required to obtain a renewable operating licence valid for four years, or face a maximum of one year in jail and or a maximum Bt20,000 fine.\n",
      "Parties aligned with Thailand s powerful Shinawatra clan are staging major rallies this weekend ahead of a court ruling that could deal a gut punch to their prospects in national elections later this month. Public gatherings were held across the country Saturday including in the Chiang Mai hometown of divisive billionaire and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, who lives in self exile to avoid jail in Thailand, is adored by rice farmers and large sections of urban working class voters for his pro poor policies and steering of the economy. But he is despised by the royalist elite, whose allies have failed to beat him at the polls since 2001 and instead have relied on coups and court rulings to topple Shinawatra backed governments. Thousands of people massed in Bangkok s historic center late Friday for a defiant campaign by Thai Raksa Chart, one of several parties linked to the Shinawatra clan. But Thai Raksa Chart could be dissolved by the Constitutional Court on Thursday, after its bid to run a princess as candidate for prime minister spectacularly unraveled. Supporters say the court has the future of Thai democracy in its hands with the junta determined to return as a civilian government. If it is dissolved it will damage our hopes for democracy badly, said Chailerm Phothijad, 55, at Friday night s rally in Bangkok. Thailand, which has been stuck on a carousel of coups, violent protests and short lived civilian governments since 2006 when the army booted Thaksin from office, remains deeply polarized. Nerves are mounting inside Thai Raksa Chart as the crucial ruling nears. But the party will continue to campaign as we have been . . . and leave the issue of judiciary to the court, said Umesh Pandey, a Thai Raksa Chart party list candidate. Thailand s contentious junta drafted constitution allows the junta to appoint the 250 member senate, whose votes will count toward choosing the next prime minister. There are 500 Lower House seats up for grabs, 350 through constituencies and the remainder through the party list a system of proportional representation meant to give smaller parties a foothold. Junta leader Prayut Chan ocha, who took power in a 2014 coup, wants to return as prime minister. With Thai Raksa Chart s political fate in the balance, another anti junta party led by a billionaire is emerging as an untested but significant force. Future Forward, led by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the 40 year old scion of Thailand s biggest auto parts maker, has won favor among the kingdom s millennials. More than 7 million people aged between 18 and 25 are eligible to vote this month for the first time, according to the Interior Ministry. Analysts say if Thai Raksa Chart is disbanded its supporters may cast votes for Future Forward.\n",

      "by Bill Barnett of C9Hotelworks.com At the beginning of the year Phuket s tourism and hotel sector was cautiously optimistic after a strong first half of 2018 and humbling second half. Key terms that kept popping up were Mainland Chinese, Thai Baht Appreciation, Elections and Supply Concerns. So today, with three months of performance under the belt in 2019 what are the key trends in hotel trading These can best be compressed in the following points According to data from hotel benchmarking group STR, Thailand remains Southeast Asia s leading destination for Mainland Chinese, but the gloss is being diminished by Vietnam s meteoric rise, and strong numbers by the Philippines and Cambodia. Market wide RevPar shunk by 0.04 in 2018 and flat demand at the onset of the year is now shifting into negative territory moving into February and beyond. Turning back to last year, group demand is falling which is as key concern in a wholesale driven marketplace. One stark positive is that RevPar is being propped up by rates and not occupancy. A key takeaway is that in peak and high season, Phuket hotels are able to drive rates up in key periods and continue to do so. This of course is a broad trend. Good hotels tend to perform at higher levels, while poorly managed ones remain subpar. Getting beyond the numbers, as I speak to hoteliers the expectation is that wholesalers remain a critical component of the island s hotel industry and despite the expected shift with technology to more direct bookings, the reality is that wholesale models are sensitive to demand volatility and the result of this feeding frenzy most often will be either flat rates for the year or in some cases a retraction. We expect the remainder of 2019 to be challenging. Some hotels will look at this as an opportunity to reposition, renovate or cut costs. While others will look at new segments, niche offerings or emerging markets like India to regain momentum. As for the top critical issues facing Phuket hotels, in my opinion these can be distilled in the following Top 3 Things Keep Me Awake at Night Mainland Chinese If tourism players or hotels believe the damage to Brand Phuket is over, think again. Talking to key tour operators there remains a hangover from last year s boat sinking incident and travellers remain keenly concerned over safety. Only time and more concentrated promotion will see a return of the numbers. Growing Supply and Demand Imbalance The current pipeline is just over 8,000 keys in development on the island. What s more concerning is that projects in planning are not represented in this metric, and by our estimate there are approximately 5,000 more keys in planning. While both the pipeline and planning numbers will see some wash, the sum total exceeds current and forecasted demand. Moreso, the rise of unlicensed condominiums, apartments, houses and villas is continuing unabated and is further exacerbating supply issues. Every time you see a group of tourists renting a 3 or 4 bedroom villa, that s three or four hotel rooms that lay empty. Government control of unlicensed properties is a key issue facing Phuket s tourism industry. Diminished Natural Resources and Strained Infrastructure Water tops the list and there is little doubt we are reaching the tipping point with mounting shortages and soaring demand. Electricity is another concern. Lastly is a rising number of vehicles on the road, a urbanising trajectory and slow development of roads and public transport. To these point s lets revisit the hotel development pipeline and reflect that a island long term master plan, zoning for new tourism expansion and requirements for developers to invest in public infrastructure to obtain operating licenses is sorely lacking. Something has to give on this front. In conclusion am I pessimistic about Phuket s tourism and hotel future in 2019 and beyond Absolutely not, direct airlinks are growing and the island has a well structured capacity for handling tourism, but I firmly believe looking into our problems, discussing and finding ways to resolve these are critical to a sustainable growth pattern.\n",
      "BANGKOK A toxic herbicide linked to Parkinson s disease was approved by officials Thursday for use in Thai agriculture for at least two more years despite health concerns. Paraquat is among three controversial chemicals that will still be permitted for agricultural use, the Hazardous Substance Committee announced Thursday to the disappointment of advocates calling for its ban. The other two are glyphosate and chlorpyrifos. The use of the three herbicides and pesticides will be allowed for six crops rubber, cassava, maize, sugar cane and fruit trees. The decision passed with 16 votes in favor and five against. There were five abstentions. On Thursday anti paraquat organizations such as the Thai Pesticide Alert Network Thai PAN and Biothai Foundation protested outside the Ministry of Industry. One farmer showed reporters lacerations on his leg he said resulted from exposure to paraquat. After the committee announced its decision, Thai PAN issued a statement saying its members were disappointed and saddened by the decision. We ll apply for consideration again in two years, the statement read. Such a decision shows indifference toward the strong academic evidence and demands from several organizations. Paraquat is the main ingredient in Swiss based Syngenta AG s Gramoxone one of the world s three most widely used weed killers but is also sold under other brand names. It is banned in nearly 50 countries including all of Europe, which banned it in July 2007. Syngenta says paraquat is safe and effective when used as directed on the label. A 2011 study by the US National Institutes of Health found a link between the chemical and Parkinson s disease in farm workers.

      "New rates due to take effect on April 1 Workers such as labourers on the new Bangkok railways will receive daily raises of up to 10 baht. Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill Provincial sub committees given the task of adjusting minimum daily wage rates have proposed annual raises of between two to 10 baht this year, said permanent secretary for the Labour Ministry Jarin Jakkaphark Wednesday. The proposal is awaiting further deliberation by the central academic screening sub committee, and the planned hikes are expected to be forwarded to a tripartite committee composed of employees, employers, and the government next month. The new rates are expected to come into effect on April 1 as usual, said Mr Jarin. He also dismissed rumours that a nationwide minimum wage rate of 360 baht will be imposed, saying such a move is impossible due to the differing rates of economic growth between provinces. Meanwhile, more than 200 employees of Gamakatsu International Co in Klong Luang district of Pathum Thani continued their week long protest against the company's decision to suspend operations. The suspension allowed under Section 22 of the 1975 Labour Relations Act followed a dispute between the company and its labour union over its request for better pay and benefits, said union president Anongnat Khonchan. After eight rounds of negotiations ended in a stalemate, the employee's union decided to call a general strike beginning on Feb 14, she said. The next day, the company decided to suspend operations until the union agrees to retract all of its demands. Ms Anongnat said the dispute began on Oct 9 last year, when the union submitted a seven point request. It called for a 100 pay raise for every employee, an increase in meal allowances from 40 baht to 50 baht per day, and monthly living allowances of 1,600 baht per employee, up from the previous rate of 1,400 baht. Separately, the Labour Ministry's committee responsible for migrant workers and human trafficking is seeking the cabinet's approval to waive the 2,000 baht re entry fee for legitimate migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, who plan to temporarily leave Thailand to visit their families over the Songkran holiday period in April.\n",

Photo by Wassana Nanuam Small groups of pro and anti military activists gathered in front of army headquarters on Wednesday, expressing opinions on the army chief's fondness for an anti communist song from the mid 1970s. Activists and police also engaged in a brief song battle. The two groups showed up about the same time on Ratchadamnoen Avenue. Police quickly separated them and let anti regime activists express their views first. Among them, Prit Chiwarak called on army chief Gen Apirat Kongsompong to stop the playing of the song Nak Phandin Burden on the Land over the army's many radio outlets and at army units. He said that the lyrics accused political opponents of undermining society. Another anti regime activist, Ekachai Hongkangwan, loudly played the anti regime song Prathet Ku Mee What My Country's Got . Seconds later police countered with the national contribution song Khwam Fan An Soong Sood Greatest Dream , played briefly and loudly on a big portable speaker. Later a pro military group from Thon Buri area of Bangkok took its turn. Leading the group, Bancha Panwiwat said the military protected the country and they supported the military. About 50 police supervised the scene. Earlier this week, Gen Apirat responded to politicians' election policies promising to cut the defence budget and end compulsory conscription by recommending they listen to the song Nak Phandin a right wing anti communist song associated with the massacre of students and activists on Oct 6, 1976. This drew strong criticism, and demands that the army commander in chief stay out of politics. Anti regime activists play the song Prathet Ku Mee, which is then overpowered by police playing Khwam Fan An Soong Sood. Video by Wassana Nanuam\n",

Photo by Assawin Pakkawan SONGKHLA The checkpoint between Thailand and Malaysia in Sadao district of this southern border province was temporarily blocked by a group of motorcycle taxi drivers, obstructing the passage of vehicles carrying tourists and cargo. About 50 motorcycle taxi operators began to block the Thai Malaysian border checkpoint in Sadao district at 11am to protest against Malaysia's strict inspection of documents on motorcycle taxis taking passengers from the checkpoint to a duty free shop in Malaysia's Kedah state. Under a new, stricter measure, drivers of motorcycle taxis from the Thai side of the border are required to carry a passport, instead of a temporary border pass as before. The blockage halted the movement of vehicles taking tourists and cargo across the border in both directions for nearly one hour. The protesters agreed to end the blockage after talks with immigration police, military officers and administrative officials. However, they continued to gather near the checkpoint, calling for officials from both the Thai and Malaysian sides to ease the strict inspections.\n",

      "The January 19 story corrects last paragraph to say coronation will be first in living memory for most Thais, but not all. A placard mocking Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan o cha as Pinocchio is seen as activists hold up candles while gathering to demand quick elections to end military rule at a university in Bangkok, Thailand, January 19, 2019. REUTERS Athit Perawongmetha By Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Panarat Thepgumpanat BANGKOK Reuters Rival groups held demonstrations in Thailand s capital on Saturday, with hundreds of people demanding quick elections to end military rule and a much smaller group of pro junta supporters saying it was too soon for a vote. The competing protests were tiny compared to those that paralyzed Bangkok in 2014 before the army seized power in the name of ending instability, but were an indication of the tensions in the run up to a long delayed ballot. No date has been set for an election which was first promised for 2015 and most recently postponed from Feb. 24. Hundreds joined a demonstration calling for elections on March 10. We re calling for elections as soon as possible, activist Sirawith Seritiwa told the crowd. The junta has said the most recent election delay is because of scheduling difficulties with planning for the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in early May although it has said it still wants the ballot held before those ceremonies. The Election Commission of Thailand has given March 10 or March 24 as possible polling dates, but no date has been set and a royal decree must be issued before it can be. Some 1 km 0.6 miles from the demonstration calling for elections, around 30 counter protesters gathered with placards at the Democracy Monument. They said they were not opposed to a ballot, but national unity must come first. We can wait for elections, the group s leader, Jathurun Bunbenjara, told reporters. We don t agree with protests that create chaos... We want to see Thais come together and hold an auspicious and great coronation. Thailand s longstanding political divide is between strongly royalist and pro military conservatives and red shirt populists linked to exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra who have won every election since 2001. Despite measures by the junta to entrench the ruling generals hold on power after any election, opinion polls have shown that Thaksin s supporters remain politically strong. Activist Sirawith denied that the group intended to create chaos ahead of the coronation saying that holding elections earlier would reduce that danger. For most people it will be the first Thai coronation in living memory. The king s revered late father reigned for more than 70 years until his death in 2016.\n",

      "Demonstrators gather in cities across country as military government looks set to push back voting for a fifth time Tensions continue to mount in Thailand as the ruling military junta has signalled that the long postponed elections will be delayed yet again, the fifth delay in less than five years. On Sunday, in one of the biggest pro democracy protests in Thailand in over four years, hundreds of people took to the streets for the third time in a week to criticise the military government for appearing to renege on assurances the election would finally happen on 24 February. It is the fifth time the military junta, which took over in a bloodless coup in 2014, has delayed elections and prevented the country s return to democracy. Known as the National Council for Peace and Order NCPO , it has repeatedly declared the country is not ready for elections but the most recent delay has been attributed to concerns it would interfere with the upcoming coronation of the new king. Over the weekend about 200 demonstrators gathered at Bangkok s Ratchaprasong Intersection the symbolic spot where dozens of pro democracy demonstrators were killed in an army assault in 2010 carrying banners demanding an election by next month, while smaller groups gathered in other cities across Thailand. The army s commander in chief, General Apirat Kongsompong, publicly condemned the protesters, saying they were bent on causing trouble . Thais to vote in February for first time since invalidated 2014 poll Read more They are being told to think this way, ordered to behave this way, thinking in one single mode without taking into consideration other factors which are reasonable and without looking at the constitution, Aparit, who is also secretary general of the NCPO, told a media conference. While many in Thailand are sceptical about the promised elections ever taking place, the February date seemed almost secure after a promising announcement by the election commission late last year. The ban on political activity and gatherings of more than five people was also lifted in late December, the strongest indicator that elections would go ahead. But election hopes were dashed again in early January when the military failed to issue the awaited official decree, which formalises the election date. Days later, deputy prime minister Wissanu Krea ngam indicated the poll would be postponed because it could interfere with rituals and preparations for the coronation of Thailand s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, which will be held on 4 6 May. The election commission has not yet formally announced the postponement but the ongoing delay in the decree now makes it highly likely. Thailand s last official election was eight years ago, in 2011, and occurred following months of pro democracy protests by activists known as the red shirts , and saw the election of Yingluck Shinawatra, Thailand s first female prime minister and the sister of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Another poll was held again in 2014, but it was later invalidated by the constitutional court, and the military took power in a coup shortly after. According to Thailand s new constitution, which skews the political system heavily in favour of maintaining military power, an election must happen by 9 May.\n",
      "Pro democracy protesters demonstrated Sunday at the Ratchaprasong intersection in Bangkok, and in half a dozen provincial towns. Photo by Wichan Charoenkiatpakul Protests were held in Bangkok and several up country provinces on Sunday to demand an end to delays in the general election, which was last promised for Feb 24 but now is in limbo. In the capital, about 150 people gathered in the evening at Ratchaprasong intersection to call on the military regime to hold the election before the coronation of His Majesty the King in May. Hardliners in the government have recently said that election related activities may clash with the ceremony running smoothly, leading to concerns that the election, already unlikely for Feb 24, could be delayed even beyond March. They have been postponing the election over and over since 2014, complained a 51 year old female protester. The election must be held before the coronation. Police did not block the demonstration, but did not allow the protesters to use a public address system. In Chiang Mai, about 20 people protested at City Hall under the watchful eyes of police, who also did not interfere. A 62 year old retired teacher who said his name was Boonrod, said income disparities have widened under the current government. Only rich people get benefits from the current government's policies, he said. Protests were also held in other provinces including Chiang Rai, Nakhon Pathom, Khon Kaen, and Ubon Ratchathani. The government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha has delayed the vote six times since it first promised elections in 2015.\n",
      "Sunday 13 January 2019 saw more protests in the Ratchaprasong area of Bangkok and different provinces in Thailand, including Ubonratchathani, Phayao, Phrae, Nakhon Pathom, Mahasarakham, and Chiang Rai. This was the third protest in Bangkok after the NCPO revoked its ban on people's freedom of expression. Protest at Ratchaprasong Source Resistant Citizen At 15.00, Ekkachai Hongkangwan, along with 10 other protesters, arrived early at Ratchaprasong with No Election Delay and 24 Feb Election signs in Thai and Chinese. At 17.30, Sirawith Serithiwat from the People Calling for Election group read a statement No delay. No cancellation. No extra time. Here is an English translation of the full statement Today we have almost completely run out of patience with the duplicity and the repeated attempts at excuses, and with the accusations to silence the media and the people calling for the fundamental rights of citizens. We present this ultimatum to the NCPO Government No delay the election must be held no later than 10 March 2019 because otherwise, the ECT will not be able to announce election results within 150 days of 11th December 2018 when the Organic Law on the Election of MPs was promulgated, thus making the election unconstitutional and invalid. No cancellation the election must not be cancelled by tricks, excuses, or legal technicalities, even though there are attempts to do this today and there will be in the future. No extra time for them to remain in power through the constitution written to give them an advantage, whether by using 250 votes from the appointed senate to support their hold on to power, or by using its status as the government with complete authority over the budget, or by shifting government officials around without scrutiny during the election campaign, or by discrimination favouring the political party that was set up to keep them in power. This can all be held to be election fraud. If by Friday 18 Jan, there has been no Royal Decree announced in the Government Gazette opening the way for the election and setting a date for the polls, we will consider the NCPO government to have demonstrated in the clearest way possible its insincerity in handing over power to the people and we will ramp up the protest at the Democracy Monument at 5 pm on Saturday 19 Jan. Protest at Ratchaprasong Source Resistant Citizen In the evening, Winthai Suwaree, NCPO spokesperson, stated that the majority of people were following the election news with judgement, understood the situation well, and were willing to create an atmosphere of rejoicing to celebrate the election and the auspicious coronation. Discrediting the protestors as having turned professional , Winthai claimed that they do not understand the bigger context. The movement is implicitly criticism with a negative attitude. This is not like democratic expression and does not create any social benefit. The People Calling For Election group have recently become more angry in their words, especially when they raise an issue as the democratic side and push others towards the opposite. It may be seen that their democratic maturity is defective, Winthai said. Thai Army Chief Gen Apirat Kongsompong also said that pro election rallies are inciting chaos , according to Khaosod English. There are people like this in Thai society. I don t know what to say they want chaos. I think those who understand are irritated, Apirat said. There are people who want to lead a normal life and make a living. In the previous demonstration, protesters fully cooperated with the police to make sure that the ordinary can walk unhindered. As this protest was dissolving, the police came in asking to seize the audio amplifier, claiming that the noise level was above the limit. The protest leaders asked to see a warrant, but the police declined to show it. While the two sides are still negotiating, the police are preventing the protesters from going home. Tensions rose, but the situation was diffused when protest leader Nattha Mahatthana agreed to continue negotiations at Lumphini police station. Meanwhile, demonstrations were held in Chiang Rai and Ubon Ratchathani. Sombat Boonngamanong, a prominent Thai activist, joined the protest in Chiang Rai. I have taken back my bank account from the authorities. Next, we will take back democracy that s a big account, said Sombat Boonngamanong in a soft tone. Please deliver what you promised.

The protesters are demanding that the military junta, the rulers of Thailand since the last coup in 2014, hold a general election on Feb. 24 as has been promised for months. The junta, however, has said that the election will likely be delayed due to it conflicting with preparations from the crowning of His Majesty Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun Rama X scheduled for May.

Anger is rising, with the government yet to offer a clear explanation, other than concern that the time needed to formalise the poll outcome could interfere with preparations for the coronation of His Majesty the King, an event now set for early May. More demonstrations are planned for Sunday, at the Ratchaprasong intersection in Bangkok and at city halls in all 76 provinces. Sirawith said the hundreds of people participating in the Korat protest on Tuesday was an indication that many Thais mistrust the generals and want to see the election take place next month. The coup installed government had offered no sound reason to further postpone the poll after at least five prior delays, Sirawith said, adding that citizens could no longer tolerate the current political situation. A delayed election could also interfere with national university entrance exams, stirring anger among high school students who vented their annoyance on social media. Because February 24 appeared to be the chosen election date, aptitude testing for high school seniors that was slated for the same period had to be moved forward, to February 16 19. The likelihood of another date change has riled the students again after all the earlier bother. Some demanded that the testing be rescheduled for February 24 if the election wasn t taking place that day. Fresh student complaints were still appearing online yesterday most bearing a hashtag in Thai that can be translated as delaymyass . Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea ngam said yesterday that a clearer picture of the poll timing would emerge today. He said Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha would today be meeting with the committee in charge of coronation preparations to discuss scheduling requirements. Asked about the fuming high school students, Wissanu said the agencies involved would consider testing them on February 24 if the election must be postponed.\n",
      "Demonstrators rally to demand the general election not be postponed in Bangkok Tuesday, Jan. 8, 2019. Demonstrators are reacting to the possibility that the scheduled Feb. 24, 2019, general elections may be postponed. Poster reads No postponement of election. AP Photo Sakchai Lalit BANGKOK AP About 200 protesters staged a rare demonstration Tuesday in military ruled Thailand, demanding that there be no further delays in holding elections, which were expected next month but have been put in doubt. The polls had seemed set for Feb. 24, but that date may slip, apparently because of the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn on May 4. Critics of the military government, which seized power in 2014, wonder if it is using the recently announced coronation date as an excuse to push back the elections. A key announcement expected last week that would have confirmed the polling day did not happen, sowing widespread confusion and doubts that the government and the election commission have so far failed to clear up. The peaceful protesters descended with little advance notice on a busy intersection in Bangkok s commercial district. Chanting, banging drums and waving placards, they demanded the poll go ahead on time. I am here to demand that the government does not delay the election, said 74 year old protester Ornapa Ngamban. If they keep delaying, I will send them to a hospital for treatment because there is something wrong with them. Don t delay the election Until recently, political gatherings of more than five people were illegal and participants liable for arrest. On Tuesday, police kept a discreet distance and did not intervene. The government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha has a long record of promising elections, but then finding reasons to delay. Many opponents believe the current confusion is a deliberate attempt to stall until he is sure that pro military parties can win enough seats to return him as prime minister. It s about keeping up the pressure, said protest co leader and prominent pro democracy activist Nuttaa Mahattana. It s about securing the election. Otherwise we have no way to fight any more for the country to return to democracy. The venue of the protest Bangkok s Ratchaprasong intersection has great symbolism for anti military protesters. It was the site of a chaotic months long mass camp out by thousands of demonstrators in 2010 that brought prolonged disruption to the city. The protest by demonstrators known as Red Shirts who said they were seeking democratic rule was crushed by an army assault in May of that year that left around 50 people dead.\n",
      "BANGKOK Reuters More than 100 opposition activists protested in central Bangkok on Sunday, accusing the election commission of delaying and manipulating the results of the first polls since a 2014 coup. An activist holds a poster as she protests the election result in Bangkok, Thailand, March 31, 2019. REUTERS Soe Zeya Tun A week after the March 24 vote, the outcome of Thailand s national election remains uncertain and might not be known until after the commission publishes official results due on May 9. The body released partial results the night of the vote, and took four more days to publish fuller counts, showing a party supporting the ruling military junta winning the popular vote but the opposition Pheu Thai party ahead in partial results of House of Representatives seats. Both the Palang Pracharat party which seeks to keep junta leader Prayuth Chan ocha in office and an anti junta democratic front of seven parties, led by Pheu Thai, have claimed a mandate to form the next government. Get out Stop cheating Respect the people chanted the protesters close to the city s Victory Monument. They urged bystanders to add to the 830,000 signatures on an online petition to impeach the commission. The commission has declined to comment on criticism of its handling of the results. The post election standoff could raise tensions just as the Southeast Asian country prepares for the elaborate coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in May. On Saturday, the king issued an order revoking royal decorations that had been awarded to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in an earlier 2006 army coup and is linked to the Pheu Thai party. The move could hurt the standing of Thaksin and the affiliated party in the eyes of many Thais, because the monarchy is revered without question in Thai culture. Thaksin linked parties have won every election since 2001. The 2014 coup ousted a Pheu Thai led government that had Thaksin s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, as prime minister.\n",

EPA EFE NARONG SANGNAK A man with a marijuana tattoo on his face smokes and looks on during a protest held to show opposition to the patent for marijuana extracts, outside the Government House in Bangkok, Thailand, Nov. 20, 2018. EPA EFE NARONG SANGNAK A group of activists on Tuesday urged the Thai government not to approve applications by foreign companies for patents on medicinal cannabis as the country is set to legalize the drug for medical purposes. Around 30 activists demonstrated in front of the seat of the government in Bangkok after several firms such as Japan's Otsuka, Luxemburg's Euro Celtique and Belgium's Solvay filed a dozen patent applications to research and develop medical cannabis. On Nov. 13, the Thai government approved a reform for legalizing medicinal use of of the drug, which now awaits a parliamentary approval. The Ministry of Commerce has rejected three of 12 applications received so far because it is illegal in Thailand to patent natural organisms and plants. But the activists are worried that patents filed by multinationals could be approved. The activists from Bio Thai and FTA Watch noted that they were in favour legalizing medicinal use of cannabis but introducing patents could hamper research into the plant's medical and therapeutic uses. Bio Thai Vice President Kannikar Kijtiwatchakul told EFE that patents for cannabis or its components were illegal under article nine of the country's patent law. He urged the government to follow the law and not approve any patent applications where cannabis is concerned. If the reform is approved in parliament, Thailand would become the first country in Southeast Asia to legalize the medicinal use of cannabis. Thailand banned the drug in 1935, and possession or transportation of up to 10 kilograms 22 pounds is punishable by a maximum of five years of imprisonment, whereas anything above 10 kg can result in up to 15 years in jail.\n"
