Yeni has worked extensively, not just in the mental health sector, but across the entire disability rights movement.\\nShe is the chairperson of the Indonesia Mental Health Association and a member of Transforming Communities for Inclusion of Persons With Psychosocial Disabilities TCI Asia Pacific an alliance of people with psychosocial disabilities and their supporters.\\nSpeaking to the Jakarta Globe, Yeni recounted how when she began campaigning even other disability advocates didn t acknowledge mental health disabilities as being within the disability rights movement in Indonesia.\\nYeni Rosa Damayanti is a long time campaigner for mental health reform in Indonesia.\\nPhoto courtesy of Andrea Star Reese HRW In 2016, Indonesia passed a mental health reform in the wake of New York based Human Rights Watch s landmark Living in Hell report on pasung the practise of shackling persons with psychosocial disabilities the modern term to describe mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar, schizophrenia and catatonia.\\nKriti Sharma, Human Rights Watch s senior researcher on disability in Asia, and author of the above report, said it gained a lot of traction in the media.\\nIn 78 percent of cases, shackling is a last resort for families who do not know how to care for a relative with a psychosocial disability.\\nSharma credits this drop in new shackling cases to the Healthy Indonesia Program With Family Approach.\\nWhile the program, launched in late 2016, covers all areas of healthcare, the inclusion of basic mental health services has given families treatment options beyond shackling relatives in cages or sheds, or committing them to a mental health institution.\\nOnly one percent of Indonesia s annual budget is allocated to treating mental health a low figure in a country where an estimated one million people have psychosis.\\nIn parts of Indonesia, she said, mental health care is limited to only giving them medication or taking them to a mental hospital.\\nA 2013 survey by the Health Ministry said 17 percent of Indonesians have at least a minor disability.\\nThis is likely an underrepresentation, according to Human Rights Watch, since the numbers came from a self reporting survey and did not include children under 15 years.\\nYeni has campaigned for better treatment of Indonesians with psychosocial disabilities since the late 2000s, long before Human Rights Watch even began their research.\\nNow after a decade, Yeni and her colleagues are front and centre in the disability rights movement.\\nRight to Vote Yeni's current focus on securing voting rights for people kept in mental health institutions has led to backlash from conservatives.\\nIndonesia s Constitutional Court only decided to uphold the right of people with mental disabilities to vote in late 2016.\\nDisability rights activists argue that taking away the right to vote from people with psychosocial disabilities is unconstitutional.\\nThe country's legislative council DPR followed the Constitutional Court's move in November last year, passing its own resolution to grant those with mental disabilities the right to vote.\\nAce Hasan, deputy chairperman of Commision VIII at the DPR which tackles religious, social and women's empowerment issues said that every Indonesian has the right to vote.\\nThe Jakarta General Elections Commission KPU Jakarta started registering voters and everything was all nice and dandy, Yeni said.\\nYeni said there were accusations that allowing people with psychosocial disabilities to vote was a desperate attempt to tarnish the fairness of the election.\\nIt's so full of people making jokes and ridiculing us, Yeni said.\\nKriti Sharma authored Human Rights Watch's landmark 2016 report on shackling.\\nPhoto courtesy of ABC News Australia Right to Work If disability is a game, then it is not just played by politicians.\\nPsychiatrists, who hold sway over the lives of people with psychosocial disabilities, should be at the spearhead of the campaign to improve treatment for people with mental disabiilities.\\nThe real power has always been with the psychiatrists, Yeni said.\\nThough regulation has become stricter ten years ago it was not that strong, Yeni said Indonesia is one of the few countries where people can still be interned in psychiatric institutions without their consent.\\nNow, people with mental disabilities need a psychiatrist to sign off on their right to work.\\nFifteen years ago a psikotes was not necessary, but now, no matter how talented you are, if you have psychosocial disability, you are not permitted to work, Yeni said.\\nIn her speech to the UN in Geneva, Yeni told the story of how a director of a government care facility was particularly unhappy with the Constitutional Court's decision to give people with mental disabilities the right to vote.\\nThe director, who Yeni confirmed to the Jakarta Globe as the director of the Panti Sosial Bina Laras facility in West Jakarta, detested that hundreds of people with psychosocial disability in her facility were given the right to vote, Yeni told the UN forum.\\nThere are no requirements to vote , Yeni said.\\nIn August last year, KPU Jakarta began registering voters with psychosocial disabilities for the 2019 general election.\\nAs part of this process, psychiatrists were given tours of several mental health facilities across Jakarta.\\nThey re working on it, Yeni said.\\nIndonesia launched a mandatory national health insurance system in 2014 and aims to ensure the coverage including mental health care is available to 247 million Indonesians by this year.\\nThe Healthy Indonesia program, which Kriti Sharma credited with helping tackling the shackling problem, continues to be expanded.\\nAt a public seminar in Jakarta on Dec. 3 last year the International Day of Disabled Persons Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly promised that a government effort would be implemented and a cross ministerial taskforce appointed to look into human rights violations in mental health institutions.\\nWill this be enough The onus is on the government, Yeni said.\\nIt's the
