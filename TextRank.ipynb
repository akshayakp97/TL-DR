      "The Jammu Kashmir police Saturday booked 52 persons in Rajouri district for ignoring administrative orders to deposit their licensed weapons in police stations in run up to the upcoming parliamentary polls. Rajouri, which falls in Jammu parliamentary segment, is going to polls in the first phase on April 11. The district magistrates across the state have directed people to deposit their licensed weapons in local police stations as part of the efforts to ensure free and fair polls. An order in this regard was issued by Rajouri district magistrate on March 1 and all the licensed weapon holders were asked to deposit their weapons in local police stations in view of the forthcoming parliamentary polls. Although majority of licensed weapon holders deposited their weapons in police stations but some people paid no attention to the order even after police served them reminder through notices, a police spokesman said. Taking note of it, he said various cases under relevant sections of law have been registered against the violators in police stations across Rajouri district. Rajouri's Senior Superintendent of Police Yougal Manhas said the persons against whom cases have been registered would face cancellation of their licenses and the matter would be taken up with the district magistrate in due course of time. More legal actions against more such violations are being worked out by Rajouri Police in days to come, he said.\n",

      "Of late, the Kendrapada police are on an encounter spree like their Ganjam counterparts to infuse fear of the bullet among the criminals, who spread a reign of terror in the district and make life miserable for the residents. In an example, police on Wednesday nabbed dreaded criminal and sharpshooter Bijay Nayak after a gunfight in the Kajala area of the district. This was the fourth such encounter by police in last two months in the district.

According to sources, on August 12, 2016, one Dipak Oram 24 , a resident of Junadih village under Sadar police station of Sundargarh district, had gone to Abanikela village along with Ratikanta Tiga, Basant Naik, Bharia Kujur and Fakira Tiga of same village, to bring a new boat, for Ratikanta Tigga. On August 13, the four people had returned back with a new boat, while they had no clue about Dipak. Even if four persons who were accompanying him after purchasing a boat claimed that the Dipak fell inside Ib river while crossing the river, the family members of the deceased youth did not buy the story. The family members of Dipak in their complaint had accused the four persons of having colluded in the suspected murder of the youth. Dilip, brother of Dipak, had lodged a FIR against the four. The Sadar police after registering a murder case had interrogated the four suspected. Police conducted a search operation of Dipak in the river but could not locate him. The police had formed a two member team to locate Dipak and also informed all the IICs of the police stations till Hirakud about Dipak s missing and had told them to inform if Dipak is located. The police had conducted polygraph test of Basant, Bhaira and Fakira. But since Ratikanta was hiding, his polygraph test could not be done. Police searched Ratikanta but could not locate him. According to sources, during interrogation Bhaira, an eyewitness, he had disclosed that Ratikanta had pushed Dipak from boat and Dipak had drowned. Police have also brought arrest warrant against Ratikanta. We have information that accused Ratikanta along with his family has fled to Raipur and efforts are on to nab him, said Sadar police station IIC RK Sai.\n",

      "Days after the Centre s ban on the Jamaat e Islami Jammu Kashmir that owes affiliation to Pakistan s JeI, the authorities have begun sealing several properties belonging to the outfit and freezing certain bank accounts of the leaders. The estimates suggest the JeI has assets worth over Rs 4,500 crore in the State. The JeI has been banned on grounds that it was in close touch with terrorist groups and was likely to escalate secessionist movement . It is also suspected to be linked to Pakistan based terror group Lashkar e Tayyeba. The outfit has close connections with the JeI, Pakistan, and is not in any way connected to the JeI in the rest of the country, officials said. Several properties, including residential houses, owned by various leaders and activists of the banned outfit were sealed in many areas of the Srinagar and elsewhere in Kashmir on Friday night, sources said. Bank accounts of a number of JeI leaders have also been frozen. Searches were also conducted by the Income Tax Department even as the district magistrates have been asked to seek a list of moveable and immovable properties of the Jamaat leaders, the sources further said. The NIA is separately probing a money laundering case against secessionist leaders in the Valley and is likely to probe the role of the Jamaat leaders. The Centre on Thursday banned JeI Jammu Kashmir for five years under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act following apprehension that it can escalate subversive activities and attempt to carve out an Islamic state out of the territory of India. The ban follows a massive crackdown on the secessionist outfit in the Valley since last week wherein about 150 leaders and activists of the group have been detained in raids at several places across Kashmir. The Jamaat was responsible for the creation of the terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen and the brain behind the formation of Hurriyat Conference. Former J K CM Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday termed the ban as an act of vengeance , claiming JeI was a social and political organisation. She expressed apprehension that the move would have dangerous consequences .\n"

The petition also claimed that a letter was sent to the Secretary, MoEF CC, seeking directions to all state governments and the Election Commission for imposing complete prohibition of PVC hoarding banners flexes by implementing and complying with the environmental norms, but no response was received. In view of the above that while it may not be necessary for the tribunal to go into the merits at this stage, the matter may first be considered in a joint meeting of representatives of Election Commission, MoEF CC and CPCB at the earliest, preferably within one week, in such manner as may be found viable.

      "In a case of mistaken identity, the Commissionerate police here on Saturday apologised for arresting a wrong man and forwarding him to court from where he was remanded to jail custody. Family members of the victim, however, demanded compensation for causing trauma to them and stringent action against the erring policemen. Executing a six year old NBW, the Lalbag police of the city had arrested one Chandan Moharana of Chandini Chowk here on the night of March 11. He was forwarded to a local court, which in turn remanded him to jail custody on the next day. Despite the family members appeal that Chandan was innocent he is behind the bars for over 12 days now. After inquiry, it was revealed that the arrested person was in no way involved in the 2013 March criminal case. Since his name and address matched with that of the name and address mentioned in the arrest warrant, he was arrested, said the Police commissioner Satyajit Mohanty and regretted for the trauma and inconvenience caused to the family of Chandan. Mohanty assured the family of adequate cooperation from the police to ensure that Chandan is released from the jail as soon as possible with his dignity intact. We will appeal to the court pleading that the arrested person was not guilty and his arrest was a case of mistaken identity, the Police Commissioner said.\n",

      "Two Pakistani intruders suspected to be regular soldiers were killed as Indian Army claimed to have thwarted a treacherous attempt by Pakistan s Border Action Team BAT to carry out an attack in north Kashmir s Naugam sector on December 30. A defence spokesman said that the intruders attempted to move by exploiting the thick jungles close to the Line of Control LoC and were assisted by heavy covering fire of high calibre weapons such including mortars and rocket launchers from the Pakistani posts. The alertness and resilience of the own troops, who engaged and neutralised the intruders, thus eliminated a likely treacherous attack on the Army forward posts along the LoC on the eve of New Year, he said. The Army has decided to ask Pakistan to take back the mortal remains of deceased likely Pakistani soldiers since Pakistan did provide full covering fire support to these intruders. The Army said that the movement of intruders was detected by the vigilant Indian Army troops deployed along the LoC. The fire fight initiated by Pakistan was given strong retaliation by Indian Army and the exchange of fire continued the whole night, the spokesman said. Army said that during prolonged search operations in thick forests confirmed elimination of two likely Pakistani soldiers and resulted in recovery of a large cache of warlike stores. The search operations are still underway in the sector to sanitise the area. It was also reported that a few other intruders managed to escape across the LoC, taking advantage of the Pakistani firing and adverse weather and visibility conditions, the spokesman said. He said the intruders were wearing combat dresses like Pakistani Regulars and were carrying stores with Pakistani markings further reinforced the assessment. Some intruders were also seen in BSF and old pattern IA dresses as part of deception. They had intruded well equipped with IEDs, incendiary materials, explosives, and a plethora of arms and ammunition. From the recovery, it was estimated that they intended to carry out a gruesome attack on the Indian Army forward post in Naugam sector. The spokesman said that army authorities have applauded the courage and perseverance of the alert troops. The Indian Army s resolve to keep a strict vigil along the LoC and defeat all such nefarious designs of Pakistan will continue to remain firm and consistent. We will ask Pakistan to take back the mortal remains of deceased likely Pakistani soldiers since Pakistan did provide full covering fire support to these intruders, he said. In Jammu, state police chief Dilbag Singh said that the BAT attack was repulsed by the troops. Such attempts have been foiled in the past also. The security forces are capable of foiling such attempts, he said.\n"

      "Karachi Unidentified gunmen shot dead at least 14 passengers after forcing them to disembark from a bus on a highway in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province, a media report said Thursday. According to Levies sources, around 15 to 20 unidentified gunmen in camouflage uniform reportedly stopped five or six buses travelling between Karachi and Gwadar. They stopped a bus on the Makran Coastal Highway in Balochistan's Ormara area, checked the identity cards of passengers and offloaded about 16 of them. At least 14 were shot dead, while two passengers managed to escape the massacre and made it to the nearest Levies check post. They were shifted to a hospital for treatment, the Dawn newspaper reported. Levies and other law enforcement personnel reached the spot and launched an investigation into the incident. The bodies of the victims were recovered from Noor Baksh Hotel, the report said. The motive behind the killings and the identity of the victims are yet to be ascertained. Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistan's largest and poorest province, rife with ethnic, sectarian and separatist insurgencies. An ISIS suicide attack targeting Hazara Shias in the provincial capital of Quetta last week killed 21 people and injured 60 others. Armed gunmen kidnapped about two dozen passengers from two Karachi bound coaches from Balochistan's Mastung area in 2015, killing at least 19 of them in the mountainous area of Khad Kocha.\n",

      "An Army personnel was killed Sunday in firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control LoC in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district, officials said. They said the cross border firing started in Shahpur and Kerni areas of Poonch around 5.30 pm Saturday and it continued intermittently through the night. The Indian Army retaliated strongly but the casualties suffered by Pakistan were not known immediately, the officials said, adding Pakistani troops used mortar and small arms to target forward posts and villages. The soldier was critically injured around 4 am in the firing and was immediately evacuated to the military hospital, the officials said. They said he succumbed to injuries, taking the number of Army personnel killed in the last four days to two. On Thursday, 24 year old rifleman Yash Paul lost his life in unprovoked firing by Pakistan Army along the LoC in Sunderbani sector of Rajouri district. The border skirmishes witnessed a spurt after India's air strike on a Jaish e Mohammed JeM terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 in response to the February 14 Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel. Four civilians, including three members of a family, have been killed and several injured as Pakistan, since then, has targeted dozens of villages in over 125 incidents of ceasefire violations along the LoC. The year 2018 witnessed the highest number of ceasefire violations 2,936 by Pakistani troops in the last 15 years along the Indo Pak border. Pakistan continues to violate the 2003 ceasefire agreement with India despite repeated calls for restraint and adherence to the pact during flag meetings between the two sides.\n",

      "Following the announcement of parliamentary polls and with the imposition of Model Code of Conduct, the district administration, Bokaro, asked the licensed weapon holders to deposit their arms and ammunition by 24 March. Deputy Commissioner Bokaro, Dr. Shailesh Kumar Chourasia, said in case, any licence holder failed to deposit the arms, their licences would be cancelled and appropriate action would be taken against them. He said the weapon holders could deposit the same with the police station concerned of their area or with registered gun houses as soon as possible. Arms licence holders usually include bank managers, businessmen, former police officers and ex servicemen. Many also keep guns for self protection or status symbol. The election code of conduct mandates arms licence holders to deposit their weapons at the police station. Stern action would be taken against those who violate the rule, said an official. The District Collectors in their capacity as District Magistrates are empowered to grant a licence to Non Prohibited Bore while the Union Home Ministry is the licensing authority for Prohibited Bore arms, he said. The Home Department has already compiled a database of arms licence holders in the State. This was done in accordance with a directive from the Centre to prepare a nationwide catalog of arms license holders, said the official. Meanwhile few gun owners demanded exemption from the rule include mostly security guards involved in escorting vehicles carrying cash to banks and ATMs.\n",

      "Angul District Additional SP Jadunath Hansdah on March 16 reached Tarava in Dhenkanal district along with BJP Kishan Morcha leader Er Debashisa Hota to conduct a fresh inquiry into the BJP leader Salman Rout murder case during the last Panchayat election. The National Human Rights Commission NHRC had notably directed the DG Police of Odisha for a fresh inquiry after the earlier probe by the Dhenkanal SP was not accepted as neutral and fair by complainant Hota whose comments were sought by the Commission. Hota had prayed the NHRC to discard the report of the Dhenkanal SP and sought payment of compensation and punishment to the then In charge of Dhenkanal Sadar police station for misuse of power by ordering lathi charge, falsely implicating and arbitrarily arresting the family members of the deceased. The Commission considered the matter and directed the DGP Odisha to get a fresh enquiry conducted by a senior police officer of the district other than from Dhenkanal and submit the report within six weeks along with copy of injury report and treatment record of the policemen and injured persons. Further NHRC directed for involving Er Hota and his witnesses in the fresh inquiry process. Notably, after the political murder of Salman Rout during last panchayat elections, the accused had allegedly threatened the eye witnesses in front of the then Dhenkanal Sadar IIC Gyana Ranjan Samal to kill them if they fight for justice. The police had lathi charged female relatives including mother of slain Rout. ines Minister and Kamakhyanagar BJD MLA Prafulla Mallick allegedly had pressurized the police and Government machineries to save his close aide who was behind the murder. Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had met the parents of deceased at Tarava and suggested them to move the NHRC. Obeying Pradhan, Hota had lodged a case before the NHRC on behalf of the bereaved family members.\n",

      "The Delhi High Court Wednesday adjourned the hearing to May 1 on an application seeking relief to Jet Airways passengers who bought tickets in advance. The court also observed that the petition was filed for publicity as the contents of the PIL was released to the press before it came up for hearing. Advertising The application filed by activist Bejon Kumar Misra on Monday had sought directions to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA to adopt prompt redressal mechanism for all affected passengers to access full refund of air tickets with reasonable compensation or arrange alternative mode of travel for them to reach their destination as an emergency exercise. The plea said, It is common knowledge that all competitor airlines have exorbitantly increased their airfares and the toothless and vulnerable consumers are constrained to suffer not only in terms of money but also in terms of mental harassment of unprecedented scale. Citing media report, it said more than Rs 360 crore of the passengers consumers hard earned money is under threat due to non refund of ticket value. The passengers have to not only purchase alternative tickets at highly exorbitant cost, but also go through lots of anxieties and mental agony. This has resulted in profiteering by other airlines at the cost of the passengers and till date no relief has been announced by the respondents Ministry and DGCA . After months of uncertainty, Jet Airways announced a temporary suspension of its operations on April 17 as it failed to receive emergency funds from lenders. A day after the airline suspended operations, hundreds of employees gathered in the national capital seeking measures to revive the carrier, which has been in operation for nearly 26 years.

      "This is not jehad armed crusade but jahalat benighted , a village elder pleaded to Pakistani terrorists in North Kashmir s Hajin area while asking them to release a 12 year old boy who was held captive and subsequently killed on Thursday. Videos of the village elder of Mir Mohalla of Hajin surfaced on social media, showing him asking the two Lashker e Taiba terrorists, Ali alias Furkan and Hubaib, to release Atif Mir. Villagers condemn the act. The incident took place 33 km north of Srinagar where the terrorists had taken shelter in the boy s house at gunpoint, police officials said on Friday. The terrorists wanted to sexually abuse his sister but the family had helped her escape. This infuriated them and they started beating up the family members, including Atif and his old uncle Hameed Mir, they said. Hearing their cries, other people in the locality informed police. After assessing the situation, the police started rescuing the family. They managed to secure the release of the parents and other family members till they were fired upon by the holed up terrorists. We knew that the boy and uncle were trapped inside and, so, we asked the villagers to appeal to the terrorists to release them, a senior official said. Speaking in Kashmiri, the village head was the first to ask the terrorists to release the innocent boy. Do whatever you want, but this is not Jihad but Jahalat. Please release the boy, he said. The police also made an appeal through Aqeqa Begum, the wife of Hameed, who was virtually breathless as she asked the terrorists to release her husband and nephew. Simultaneously, the police made a room intervention and brought Hameed out of the house. He told them that he was assaulted by the terrorists who hit him with iron rods and an AK rifle. I tried my best to get my nephew out of this. I begged them but they remained unmoved, Hameed told the police. As pressure mounted on the terrorists, they killed the helpless Atif, the police said, adding that the security forces later mounted a heightened operation and killed both the Pakistanis. Ali had been active in the area for long and was involved in the killing of a BSF personnel and others, including death of a man whose throat was slit in front of his son.\n",

      "Opposition BJP members on Friday created ruckus in the state assembly over non implementation of 10 reservation in jobs and education for economically weaker sections in the general category in the state. BJP members raising the matter during zero hour, demanded immediate discussion on the issue by moving an adjournment motion. The BJP legislators Shivratan Sharma and Ajay Chandrakar objected that the government was intentionally delaying its implementation in the state despite promising to do so soon. The Constitution 124 Amendment Bill 2019 to provide 10 reservation in jobs and educational institutions to economically weaker sections in the general category was passed by the Parliament on January 9, the last day of the Winter Session. All families of general category people across religions whose total annual income is below Rs 8 lakh and possess less than five acres of agricultural land will get the quota benefit. Raising slogans demanding reservations for the economically weaker section among the upper castes, the opposition members trooped to the well of the House. This automatically led to their suspension. Amid chaos the Speaker adjourned the assembly for a while. The suspension of the members was lifted when the House resumed. After members reassembled, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ravindra Chaubey assured the House that very soon the reservations would be enforced after formulating an Act.\n",

      "The Sikh clerk told officers that Crain had prepared himself a cup of coffee and attempted to leave without paying. A man was arrested on hate crime charges in the US state of California after he punched a Sikh clerk and threw hot coffee on him as he believed the victim was a Muslim, according to a media report. The man, identified as John Crain, threw the hot coffee at the clerk then punched him in the face before fleeing just before 2 a.m. on Wednesday in Marysville, the Sacramento Bee reported. The Sikh clerk told officers that Crain had prepared himself a cup of coffee and attempted to leave without paying, according to a Marysville Police Department press release. He is seen in the CCTV footage confronting Crain at the front door before being attacked. The victim suffered injuries from the hot coffee, as well as a contusion on his face, police said. Police said officers were dispatched to the same store later that afternoon for another reported assault and spotted Crain walking away from the area. Later that day, officers responded to another assault in the area and found a suspect walking away matching the description of the man from the earlier incident. The suspect was arrested. Crain admitted to the officers that he had assaulted the clerk during the previous night's incident. He told police he hated Muslims and attacked the Sikh clerk because he believed he's Muslim. He was later booked into Yuba County Jail for theft, assault and hate crimes charges. The Council on American Islamic Relations and its allies from the Sikh community condemned the attack. We condemn this attack on an individual because of his faith. This hate crime represents yet another attack on our Sikh brothers and sisters fuelled by Islamophobia and those emboldened by this administration's xenophobic policies and sentiments, CAIR SV's Civil Rights Attorney Saad Sweilem said in a statement. We welcome the hate crime charges and encourage law enforcement to continue to take these clear incidents of bias seriously.\n",

      "The thwarted Border Action Team BAT raid by the Pakistan Army commandos along with terrorists on Monday was an attempt to retaliate against two of its officers injured in cross border firing with the Indian Army a fortnight ago. Desperate to raise levels of violence on the Line of Control LoC , Pakistan tried at least four times in the last few days to carry out cross border raids but were beaten back. Giving these details here, Army officials did not rule out the possibility of similar actions from across the LoC in the coming days as there was lot of pressure on Rawalpindi based 10 Corps to carry out spectacular attacks against the Indian army camps. Pakistan s 10 Corps calibrates and stokes terrorism in Jammu Kashmir by aiding and abetting infiltration besides BAT actions. These BATs comprise mixed group of Special Services Group SSG commandos and well trained terrorists. Elaborating upon the latest raid foiled by the Indian Army, sources said a BAT team of six to seven sneaked into the region of Naugam. While two of them were killed in ensuing firefight after they managed to come at least 100 to 150 metres inside Indian territory, the remaining fighters escaped back to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir POK . The encounter took place in the jurisdiction of 17 Brigade of Indian Army, they added. In an effort to take revenge for injuries suffered by two of its officers a fortnight in the same region, the Pakistan Army tried cross border at least twice including the latest one in the last ten days. However, the raids were not successful, sources said. Some weapons, apparently dropped by retreating terrorists, were also recovered. These two failed raids took place North of Pir Panjal ranges. The Pakistan Army also tried to attack Indian Army patrols two times in South of Pir Panjal range in the same period and the anti infiltration grid managed to deter them from doing so. Officials said the Indian Army has not reduced its troop strength on the LoC in the winter months anticipating a determined bid by the Pakistan Army to keep the LoC hot. This paid dividends in terms of successfully foiling the four BAT raids, they said. A change in pattern of attacking the Indian Army posts on the LoC was also noticed as the Pakistan Army was now using sniper fire from angles instead of frontal shots after the Indian Army took effective evasive measures. Local commanders were now devising tactics to counter the new tactics by the Pakistan Army, they said.\n"

      "While responding to the notice slapped by the district election officer for violation of model code of conduct, the Congress mayor Anita Sharma has stated in writing to the assistant returning officer that she had not been aware of any violation of the model code of conduct. At the same time, she has demanded action against the BJP councillors who had protested against the mayor and presented evidences of the BJP protest to the officer. Notably, on March 14 when Sharma moved around the city on an e rickshaw with her name on a flex pasted on the sides of the vehicle, the video of her riding the e rickshaw had gone viral on the social media with BJP chipping in to slam the mayor. Following this, the assistant returning officer had slapped a notice on her on March 16, asking her to respond by 18 March with valid reasons as to whether she had violated the model code of conduct enforced for the April 11 Lok Sabha poll. As she had failed to give her response by the stipulated time, the returning officer had sent her a reminder. It is learnt that the mayor waited for nearly two hours at the city magistrate s office to meet the returning officer. Thereafter, the mayor left a written response on his desk. Queried over the matter, the city assistant turning officer Jagdish Lal said It is not a necessity to submit the response to a show cause notice to the officer concerned. The response can be submitted to the office. As far as the sloganeering by the BJP councillor is concerned, we would take action if we receive the complaint supported by evidences.\n",

But since this incident, we've been keeping our kids indoors, said Sajid. Sajid's nephew Dilshad, who is also the complainant in the case, has not returned to work for the same reason. We hope that the rest of the accused persons will be brought to justice soon, he said. On March 21, a mob had attacked the two storey house of a man belonging to a minority community after a dispute over a cricket match. They barged into the house of the victim, identified as Mohammad Sajid alias Shamshad, and beat up his family. The mob ordered the family to go to Pakistan. Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, who visited the family on Monday, condemned the attack on the family and said, This type of violence can only happen when attackers have full reassurance that whatever we do, nobody will confront them. Haryana Pradesh Congress President Ashok Tanwar also visited the victim family.\n",

The government has empanelled many super specialty hospitals of Indore where the army personals and their family members will get free of cost medical facility if the ECHS refers them to these hospitals in case of acute problems. This newly opened ECHS hospital will have a team of 5 doctors including a dentist and fully trained nursing staff. Lt Colonel Vivek Shahi while talking to The Pioneer told that to open the ECHS hospital in Indore is the initiative of station commander Mhow Brigadier R S Dadwal as he noticed that the retired army personals and their families have to come to Mhow military hospital ECHS polyclinic and from here they have been referred to other hospitals of Indore if needed. Coming to Mhow from Indore and other nearby districts of Indore and again going back to Indore resulted in unnecessary travel of 50 km for the retired army personals which resulted in wastage of time energy and money and it was very difficult for old people. A proposal was sent to government of India by station headquarter Mhow for opening up of ECHS polyclinic in Indore. The government agreed on the proposal and within 15 days this ECHS clinic is set up in Indore. Commander military hospital Mhow Brigadier AS Menon, ECHS polyclinic Indore head colonel Dinesh Kumar, Colonel Vijay Khanna, OIC ECHS Colonel Guram and other retired army personals were present.\n"

      "Nine members of a family, including three children, died after a truck collided head on with their vehicle on National Highway 33 in the wee hours of Saturday. The family residing in Dhurwa locality of the Capital city was returning from Arrah in Bihar after ceremonial head shaving of a four year old boy, who is one of the deceased. Eyewitnesses said that the Innova lost its track and went on the wrong side of the Patna Ranchi highway and rammed into a truck coming from the opposite direction at around 4 am.

      "In a clear case of deteriorating law and order in Chhattisgarh s state capital, a businessman was shot dead on Tuesday from a point blank range by a police constable at his office located at busy Pachpedhi Naka locality. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel while terming the incident unfortunate offered his condolence to the bereaved family. According to police, the deceased identified as Sanjay Agrawal who used to deal in used cars. Agrawal was at his office Sai Motors located in Pachpedhi Naka locality when the accused identified as constable Manoj Sen of District Force reached his office at noon and opened fire at Agrawal. State government has dismissed the cop from service. The accused constable had paid around Rs 3 lakh to Agrawal on March 4, to purchase a car, but the latter reportedly delivered him a shabby vehicle. Unsatisfied with the deal, the constable demanded his money back. But Agrawal promised to repair the vehicle, but kept on postponing the date of delivery of the vehicle , city superintendent of police CSP Purani Basti Krishna Patel said. Enraged over the dilly dallying tactics of Agarwal, Sen reached his office and had a heated argument after which he shot at Agrawal with an INSAS rifle he was carrying. The assault rifle is issued to Manoj s relative, who is in CAF and presently posted at Mana battalion, CSP Patel added. Agrawal was later rushed to a private hospital nearby where doctors declared him brought dead, police said. Sen was arrested later and has been booked under Section 302 murder and Arms Act.

      "A joint team of State Police and Central Reserve Police Force CRPF on Thursday gunned down three Tritiya Prastuti Committee TPC rebels and recovered an AK 47 and two Automated Machine Guns during a gun battle at Bundu Village in Hazaribagh. Acting upon a tip off from intelligence sources, the 190 battalion of the CRPF and Chatra Police conducted the encounter under Keredari Police Station of the district, around 85 kilometer North West of State Capital. The neutralized rebels were not identified by the time this report was filed. However, CRPF sources said that they most likely held senior positions in the rebel outfit since the arms and ammunitions recovered from their hideout were modern and expensive. Sources said that as the security forces entered the Tara forest, where the rebels were hiding, the TPC ultras opened fire at them. The three ultras were killed in retaliatory firing by security forces. Acting upon a tip off from our sources, the 190 battalion of the CRPF planned and executed the operation. We are still in the process of identifying the gunned down rebels, said Prakash Badal, spokesperson, CRPF Jharkhand. According to figures with the Ministry of Home Affairs, at least 18 of 24 districts in Jharkhand are Left Wing Extremism LWE affected. Apart from the CPI Maoists , there are at least 17 splinter outfits active in the tribal state. The TPC was formed in 2002 after some cadres of the CPI Maoists decided to quit the banned rebel group and form their own outfit. The TPC in Jharkhand has been at war with the CPI Maoists over ideological differences since its formation. Additional Director General of Police Operations , ML Meena said that Chatra police played a crucial role in the anti insurgency operation. All the rebels gunned down in the operation are members of the Azad Dasta of TPC, said Meena.\n",

Committee of Administrators CoA members Diana Edulji and Lt General Ravi Thodge, BCCI acting president C K Khanna and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, were present at the ceremony. Lt Gen Thodge handed over 11 crore to the Army Lt General Sanjeev Kanal, while Khanna gave away 1 crore to Rear Admiral Alok Bhatnagar. Chaudhry handed over a cheque for 1 crore to Group Captain Deepak Ahluwalia and Edulji presented a cheque for 7 crore to CRPF DIG S Elango. As a federation, we felt it was best not to hold a regular IPL opening ceremony. Instead, we decided to contribute the amount towards a cause that is so important and close to everyone's heart, CoA Chairman Vinod Rai said in the BCCI release. Edulji said, This comes as a welcome move and as a mark of respect to the ones who lost their lives in the terror attack. The BCCI has always been sensitive towards issues of national interest and will continue to make contributions whenever the need arises.\n",

      "Seven soldiers and 38 militants died in an assault by the jihadist group Boko Haram in southeastern Niger, the defence ministry said on Saturday, the latest in a series of attacks that have shattered months of relative calm near the Lake Chad basin. Armed forces... Strongly repelled an attack by the terrorist group Boko Haram on the outskirts of Gueskerou, the ministry said in a statement read on state television. Gueskerou is located in the Niger region of Diffa close to the birthplace of Boko Haram in neighbouring northeastern Nigeria. According to a provisional toll, seven soldiers and 38 terrorists were killed. One was taken prisoner. Five vehicles belonging to the attackers and a large quantity of weapons four AK47 rifles, eight machine guns, two RPG rocket launchers, ammunition were recovered , the statement added. The attack on Friday was the second in less than a month and targeted a remote military position on Lake Chad, which straddles Niger, Nigeria and Chad, the scene of many raids by the jihadist group since 2015. On February 16, seven Niger soldiers were killed during an attack on Chetima Wangou, also in southeastern Niger. In early January, the Niger army claimed to have killed more than 280 Boko Haram militants in days of land and air raids. In November, around a dozen girls were taken in raids on several border villages in the southeast. In the same month, seven local employees of a French drilling firm and a government official were killed after suspected Boko Haram gunmen stormed their compound. The government on Friday night named a new governor in Diffa. Mohamed Mouddour will replace Mahamadou Bakabe who had been in post since April 2018. No reason was given. Boko Haram s bloody insurgency began in northeastern Nigeria in 2009 but has since spread into neighbouring countries, prompting a regional military response. Some 27,000 people have been killed and two million others displaced, sparking a dire humanitarian crisis in the region. Militants have targeted both soldiers and civilians and have been blamed for abductions of children and employees of foreign companies.\n"

      "Ranchi police on Thursday recovered bodies of two brothers from the abandoned office of a private news channel in Ashok Nagar hours after their family lodged a missing complaint with the Lalpur Police Station in Ranchi. Mahendra Agarwal and Hemant Agarwal, who worked with a cargo company, left their residence in Shivam Apartment on Wednesday night. Their family lodged a complaint with the Lalpur Police Station fearing that the two may have been abducted by one Laukesh Choudhary, the franchise owner of a private news channel. When the police visited the news channel s office on Thursday morning, they found the main door locked and learned that the channel has been shut. Inside the premises of the locked office, police found bodies of Hemant and Mahendra lying in a pool of blood. The two were shot dead and the police suspect that there were at least four more persons present at the spot at the time of the incident. Superintendent of Police City , Sujata Veenapani said that initial investigation indicates that Choudhary played a role in the double murder. However, Choudhary is absconding and the police have launched a manhunt to nab him. Prima facie, it seems that the franchise owner of the news channel is behind the murder. He is absconding, said Veenapani. Family of Mahendra and Hemant claim that there was some financial dispute between Choudhary and the two brothers. Choudhary may have first abducted them and then executed the murder, they told the police. Om Prakash Agarwal, father of the deceased brothers, said that the two had left home in hurry on Wednesday evening and their phones became unreachable in the night.\n",

      "Twenty five people from Dalit families, including women, who were part of a carol team of St Paul s Anglican Church at Pathamuttam, in Kerala s Kottayam district, have taken refuge at the church for the last ten days fearing attack from men associated with the DYFI, the youth wing of ruling CPI M in the state. Advertising A group of men belonging to DYFI, allegedly in an inebriated state, had attacked the carol team on December 23, and molested women in the carol team, according to the victims. The same night, church secretary Robin Johnson said, the gang vandalised the church and left several people injured. Seven DYFI workers were arrested, and later released on bail. DYFI s Kottayam district president K R Ajai admitted that youths from the outfit were involved in the attack. They had gone to the church to question the carol members after the scuffle, but the issue was over then after the second instance of face off . These families are now camping at the church to make political gains, he claimed. Church official Johnson, however, said that after the initial attack on the carol team, the group was camping at the church when the youths regrouped and reached the church at night. They threw stones at women and children, leaving many of them injured. The gang vandalised the church, destroyed food prepared for the faithful and left only after the carol team raised alarm by chiming the bell, Johnson said. Advertising According to Johnson, the victims are daily labourers, and since the incident none has gone for work. They fear being attacked again. The assailants roam around the church premises and issue threats, he alleged. Kottayam s Superintendent of Police Hari Sanker said considering the gravity of the case, the probe has been handed over to a Special Crime Branch team. The SP said We have initiated steps to provide them security. A molestation case has been registered. Those named by the victims were arrested. As per the bail condition, the arrested accused should not enter the village. Congress s state unit working president Kodikunnil Suresh, who visited the families at the church, blamed laxity on part of the police. He said the police arrested only seven people but more DYFI workers were involved. On Tuesday, the state human rights commission registered a suo motu case and sought a report from the police.\n",

People mainly of villages, Binatupura and Paikasahi, under Baunsagadia panchayat, are encountering the difficulties. Khaira CHC doctor Mrutunjay Biswal, however, stated that he had no information of skin diseases, but assured to take appropriate actions when complaints are received. Sources said the village, a rocky area close to stone quarries, has two tube wells with about 300 families depending on them. One of them while has gone defunct since long, another one is delivering contaminated water. The villagers alleged that black iron particles come out in water from the tube well. Due to high content of iron particles in water, the residents are facing skin and other ailments, they complained, further adding that after hours of storing the water at home, it takes a reddish colour. They alleged the use of the contaminated water for taking bath and other purposes, including cooking and drinking, leads to serious health problems. The local Panchayat Samiti member said that since the area was under rocky patch and close o the hills, the tube wells provide iron laced water. He, however, assured to draw the attention of the authorities in this regard.\n"

A large number of farmers, under the banner of Kisaan Majdoor Sangharsh Committee, resorted to blockade of rail track on March 4 in support of their several demands, including full loan waiver, stopping auction of land and arrest of farmers, payment of sugarcane crop with 15 per cent interest. The protest was being led by committee president Satnam Singh Pannu at Devidaspura, around 22 kilometers from Amritsar. Pannu alleged that farmers were being harassed and humiliated by banks and other financial institutions for their failure to repay loans. He claimed that the farmers were not being paid sufficient dues of their yield. The protest led to termination of eight trains, including New Delhi Amritsar Shatabdi Express, and diversions of 24 trains, officials said.

Representational Image Raichur In a gruesome incident, a burnt body of a young girl was found hanging from a tree in a forest in Karnataka s Raichur district on Tuesday. One person has now been arrested for murder. The deceased has been identified as Madhu Pathara and was said to have been raped and burnt to death, and then hung from the tree. The incident happened reportedly on April 13 and her body was found on April 16 in the forest near her college. According to reports, the perpetrators tortured her and forced her to write a suicide note before she was killed. In her alleged suicide note, she stated that she was committing suicide because she had study backlogs. Many of her acquaintances, however, said that the claim is evidently false because she had cleared all her subjects. Madhu s father, Nagaraj Netaji, filed a complaint at the police station that she had not committed suicide but was burnt and hung. Angry social media users have shared horrifying photos and alleged the victim was raped. A hashtag asking for justice for the young woman has been widely used. Hundreds of locals took out a candle march in memory of the girl demanding justice for her family.\n",

      "The suspense over the abduction of a police sub inspector and his teacher friend who were reportedly taken hostage by Maoists on Sunday from the insurgency hit Dantewada district ended following their release on Monday night. SI Lalit Kashyap and teacher Jaisingh Kureti were released late on Monday night and they safely reached the CRPF s Sameli camp on Tuesday morning, Superintendent of Police SP Dantewada Abhishek Pallava said. According to the SP, Naxals questioned Kashyap about the movement of police personnel and security camps in the area for two days before releasing the duo. Notably, they were abducted from Jabeli village under Aranpur police station area on Sunday morning when Kashyap had gone to consume liquor with Kureti, a contractual teacher in a government primary school there. Kashyap, a district police personnel, is posted at the camp of 'C' company of CRPF's 111th battalion in Sameli village for coordinating between local police and paramilitary personnel during anti Naxal operations. According to police, Kureti had come to Sameli camp for some work on Sunday morning, and then Kashyap went along with him to Jabeli, located in a very sensitive area near his posting place, to consume liquor. A group of 40 50 armed Naxals led by militia commander Deva stormed the village and took away the SI and the teacher with them, police said. Naxals questioned Kashyap about the movement of police personnel and security camps in the area for two days. Besides, ultras also warned Kureti to stay away from the police personnel, the SP said. Meanwhile, Naxals also tried to trap security forces by spreading false information that they had killed the abducted SI. But the security forces took all the necessary precautionary measures while searching for their whereabouts in the forest area, he added. Due to mounting pressure from local public representatives and villagers, Naxals had to free the policeman and teacher on Monday late night, the SP said. Kashyap has been suspended for alleged negligence in discharging duty as he went outside the camp without permission and consumed liquor during the duty hours, he said. During the probe, it also came to light that even in the past, he had allegedly left the camp many times without informing anyone, Pallava said, adding that a departmental enquiry has also been initiated against the SI.\n",

Addressing a Press meet here on Friday, NKS national covnenor Akshay Kumar said farmers would lie down on the roads leading to villages as a mark of protest on the day of polling. The demonstrations would be held peacefully, he said. Kumar said that though farmers have been holding repeated rallies for fulfilment of their demand, the Government has remained apathetic and forcing them to steps like boycotting the elections. Farmers in around 80 per cent of the villages in the State will oppose the elections due to the insensitivity of the Government. We will send a memorandum to the President, the State Governor and the Election Commission of India in this regard, said Kumar. Sources said awareness programmes would be held at the village level and poll boycott preparations would be finalised on March 13 and 14 at a meeting of the NNKS s State executive meeting.\n"

      "Fatal accidents have registered a steep rise in the early stages of 2019 in the Millennium City. According to the official data, 239 cases have been registered till March 15. These incidents have claimed 97 lives while 16 were seriously injured. The Gurugram police, as well as experts, have identified 15 dangerous spots on the expressway where the fatal accidents took place. The number of fatal accidents was also shocking in 2018 when 446 deaths occurred. However, in 2017 around 421 deaths were reported due to accidents. A total number of 1,096 accident cases were registered in the previous year while 1,133 persons were injured. The number of injured was 1,114 in 2017. Meanwhile, experts said that the increase in high speed roads and lack of traffic police was the main cause of accidents. Officials also blamed the high density of population and increasing number of vehicles for the accidents. Narsinghpur village and Kherki Daula toll were among the major accident prone spots where around 40 to 50 fatal accidents have been recorded every year. These two spots have recorded most number of fatal accidents on the Delhi Jaipur Expressway. The Delhi Gurugram Expressway is one of the busiest stretches in the district. Three underpasses at Iffco Chowk, Signature tower and Rajiv Chowk on the National Highway have been operational. As of now, these projects are playing a major role to erase traffic volume on the carriageway, Subhash Boken spokesperson of the Gurugram police, said. Although, In November, the Gurugram police set up seven assistance booths on the National Highway. There are six PCR vans and one bike each and three ambulances deployed on the highway. The NHAI National Highway Authority of India should improve the condition of NH 48 and concretize those stretches which are in poor shape so that the number of accidents could be decreased, a traffic official, said. The city requires more traffic police personnel to control the current traffic problems. At present, there are only 500 traffic police personnel in the city to manage entire district traffic. The work on various projects in the district are underway these stretches will provide a big relief to commuters in Gurugram, a senior NHAI official said.\n",

      "Former Paralakhemundi MLA K Narayan Rao and many cadre leaders of Gajapati district resigned from the primary membership of the BJD here on Tuesday. Rao and his supporters resigned as he didn t get the BJD ticket for the Paralakhemundi Assembly seat. Earlier, Rao and about 3,000 supporters gathered at Ranipentha where they discussed about the ticket issue. Supporters lamented saying that the party has done injustice to Rao even though he served the party for many years and did many developmental activities in the State. They resolved support Rao for any decision he takes. In the afternoon, Rao, Kashinagar block chairman CH Simadri, Goshani block Chairperson CH Tarekeshawari, three Zilla Parishad members, 30 Sarapanches and 32 Samiti members, Paralakhemundi town president Jamidar Patnaik, BYJD district president P Krishan and many others resigned from the party. However, it was not clear whether Rao would switch over to any other party or fight the Assembly seat independently. He said he would take a decision in this regard soon. It may be noted that Princess Kalyani Gajapati has been named for the seat in the BJD s first set of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies. While in the Congress, Rao was elected as Chairman of the Kashinagar block twice. Later, he joined the BJD in 2000. However, he fought the elections from the Assembly seat as Independent candidate in 2000 and 2004 as he was not given a party ticket. But in 2009, he won the seat on a BJD ticket. In 2014, he lost the seat to the Congress candidate at a very low margin of votes.\n",

RK Sinha was hopeful of BJP ticket for the seat. Prasad drove away while telling the media, I thank my party for considering me for this great responsibility. I will be giving my best shot. Good governance will help Narendra Modi return to power. As supporters of Prasad and Sinha shoved each other and exchanged blows, they were quelled by security personnel deployed at the airport, though it was not known if any of them were detained.

      "Taking action against the deputy director of mining for not providing information sought, the Haridwar district magistrate has directed that the official s salary be withheld till further orders. The official has also been directed to provide clarification in writing. Further, the DM Deepak Rawat and senior superintendent of police Janmejay Khanduri also inspected six stone crushers and got them sealed on finding irregularities there. According to official communication, to stop illegal mining in the district, the DM had earlier directed the deputy director verbally on many occasions to provide information about the quantity of materials being brought to stone crushers and the quantity being sent out from the crushers. However since the said information was not provided, it seemed as if the officials was not interested in stopping illegal mining and following instructions of the senior officer. Considering this negligence in work, the DM ordered withholding his salary and sought clarification from him. Further, on Wednesday, the DM and SSP along with other officials acted on complaints of illegal mining and revenue theft at stone crushers and inspected six locations in Buggawala area. These six stone crushers were sealed due to irregularities found there.\n"

      "Following the rejection of three nomination papers by the election commission, 17 candidates are left in the fray for Haridwar Lok Sabha constituency. The objections raised against the BJP and the Congress candidates have been rejected by the district election commission after the hearing was held with the district magistrate Deepak Rawat in the chair. In all, 20 candidates had filed their nomination papers for the April 11 Lok Sabha poll from the constituency. Independent candidate Manish Verma had raised objection to the nomination paper of the BJP candidate Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank. The objections listed in the affidavit raised some issues, including his unpaid rent against the possession of a house in Dehradun by way of being the former CM of the state. The lawyer of Nishank defended his client and said the objections to his nomination were untenable. He further said that there was no outstanding regarding the rent of the residence Nishank had as the former chief minister of the state. Similar charges were made against the Congress contestant Ambrish Kumar by a resident of Vishnu ghat Pradeep Kumar. The charges made were that the candidate had not disclosed a case registered against him during the 2017 Assembly poll and he had kept away information of a flat he had from the nomination details this time. However, the lawyer for Ambrish Kumar said that the government had taken back the case and he had sold the flat off.

      "Cardio thoracic Vascular Surgery unit of the Dr Bhim Rao Ambekdar Medical College Hospital, Raipur MECAHARA performed a rare operation to implant artificial vein by removing blocked stomach vein of a patient. This was for the first time such surgery was conducted in a government hospital in the state. Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgeon and HOD CTVS Dr Krishnakant Sahu and his team performed the high risk Aortic bifemoral bypass surgery on the patient with a Aorta iliac block in abdomen, hospital sources said. The patient is now ready to be discharged, the sources added. Suresh 50 , a driver by professions, was complaining of leg pain for the last 10 years. To suppress his discomfort, he had been taking pain killers. But his situation aggravated leading to gangrene, a situation where the patient s leg has to be amputated. Suresh was also addicted to Beedi. During CT angiography, the blockage in abdominal aorta was detected. The doctors then brought the artificial graft vein from Mumbai as it was not available in Raipur. The Y shaped graft was implanted after eight days. The family was briefed about the high risk surgery as it leads to heavy bleeding in case any veins get cut during the process. In addition to that blood s thickness is reduced for smooth flow and does not coagulate. So in case of any injury, blood flows out of the body faster. Later the 7x14 and 15 cm Y shaped graft was placed by bypassing the main aorta. Thus the patient was saved from cutting of his leg by restoring the blood flow. The operation was held for three and a half hours. According to Dr Krishnakant Sahu, daily in OPD around four to six such patients are reported. Of them 95 are smokers.\n",

      "Politicians cutting across party lines came out strongly against the J K Governor administration s move to shut a 270 km stretch of the national highway from Udhampur to Baramulla to daytime civilian traffic on two days of the week, with former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti announcing that she would move court against the callous and absurd ban , National Conference president Farooq Abdullah slamming the order of a dictatorship , and People s Conference chairman Sajad Lone saying the Governor s order had created a humanitarian disaster . Advertising The government has cited the recent suicide bombing of a security forces convoy in Pulwama which killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel as the reason for restricting traffic. There was widespread resentment in the Valley on the first day of the civilian traffic ban, even as people braced for far worse on Wednesday, which, unlike Sunday, will be a working day. Read Mindless , open air prison Omar, Mehbooba on J K highway ban What is the significance of Jammu and Kashmir s main highway Advertising The lifeline of J K The entire length of the national highway Jammu Srinagar Uri runs 370 km, nearly three fourths of which has been ordered shut to civilian traffic from dawn to dusk on Wednesdays and Sundays. The highway is the lifeline of the Kashmir Valley not just the only road link that connects Kashmir to the outside world but also the key highway that connects Srinagar with the southern and northern districts of the Valley. The highway passes through five of the Valley s 10 districts, and highways to at least two more districts branch out from it. The Jammu Srinagar Uri national highway, directly and indirectly, impacts a population of over 69 lakh. This is the first time in three decades of militancy in Kashmir that the highway has been ordered closed to civilian traffic for two days of the week. A virtual lockdown The order translates into a virtual lockdown of the Valley for two days every week. According to official figures, over 10,000 vehicles move on the highway from both sides every hour, including around 5,000 light motor vehicles. These include vehicles carrying students, patients, government officials and businessmen. Shutting the highway during daytime would mean that most government and private offices, banks, schools and colleges would have to remain shut on Wednesdays, and the movement of people to hospitals would be severely restricted on Wednesdays and Sundays. At least seven important hospitals including three big government hospitals District Hospital Baramulla, Trauma Hospital, Pattan, and SKIMS Medical College Hospital at Bemina, Srinagar are located on the national highway. In addition, at least two colleges, six higher secondary schools, and scores of government and private schools including the Valley s top 10 private ones are on the highway. Almost all colleges, higher secondary institutions and schools in five districts of the Valley are accessible only through this highway. Besides, there are hundreds of villages and towns spread on both sides of the highway from Udhampur to Baramulla. The ban would effectively cut them off from other places on two days every week. Lengthy detours The shutting of the highway means journeys to Srinagar from Anantnag or Awantipora are virtually impossible. To come to Srinagar from Baramulla, commuters will have to travel 20 km to Sopore, and then 60 km towards Srinagar via Sumbal village. Thereafter, a 1 km stretch of the highway cannot be avoided and would have to be covered on foot in the absence of vehicular transport. Srinagar is another 10 km away. In the normal course, the distance from Baramulla to Srinagar on the national highway is only 55 km.\n",

      "Trouble seems to be mounting for BJP Puri Lok Sabha seat candidate Sambit Patra as a show cause notice has been served on him for allegedly violating the election model code of conduct during a campaign rally. The Puri District Magistrate, who is the District Election Officer, has issued the show cause notice to Patra, saying that even permission was not granted to Patra to hold the rally . The notice was issued hours after the Congress and the BJD attacked the BJP leader s campaign by holding an idol of Lord Jagannath during his rally from Bhubaneswar to Puri. A six member team of the Congress had petitioned Chief Electoral Officer Surendra Kumar alleging that Patra had violated the model code of conduct. The BJD has also accused Patra and the BJP of indulging in politics over religion by exploiting the sentiments of people. When elections approach, they bring up the Ram Mandir issue. They do politics over religion. We won t allow them to exploit people s sentiments, BJD leader Subhas Singh said. Besides, a complaint was also lodged against Patra at the Singhadwar police station here in this regard.

      "A soldier was injured on Tuesday as Pakistan again violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked mortar shelling and firing of small arms on forward posts and villages at two places along the Line of Control in Jammu Kashmir, officials said. The unprovoked firing from across the border took place in Nowshera sector in Rajouri district and Krishna Ghati in Poonch district, prompting effective retaliation by the Indian Army, a defence spokesman said. Official sources said a sepoy, guarding a forward post in Kalal area of Nowshera sector, suffered a bullet injury in the firing from across the border and was subsequently admitted to a hospital. The defence spokesman said Pakistani troopers first targeted forward posts and villages in Nowshera around 11 30 am and the cross border skirmishes continued for some time. Pakistani army also initiated shelling with mortars and small arms in Krishna Ghati sector around 6pm, the spokesman said. He said the Indian Army retaliated strongly but the casualties on the Pakistani side could not be known immediately.

      "After 22 days since the double murder of Agarwal brothers that shook the state capital on March 6, the police have stumbled upon several evidences against the prime accused and got a clearer picture of the crime by interrogating two private bodyguards involved in perpetrating the murders. However, the prime accused Laukesh Chaudhary and his aide MK Singh have remained absconding. On March 7, the police recovered bodies of brothers Hemant Agarwal and Mahendra Agarwal lying in a pool of blood inside the locked premises of a private news channel in Ranchi s Ashok Nagar locality. Chaudhary was the franchise owner of the news channel. According to the investigating team, Hemant and Mahendra left their residence in Lalpur s Shivam Apartment on March 6 to meet Chaudhary. Their family lodged a missing complaint with the Lalpur Police Station after the brothers did not return till late in the night and their phones became unreachable. Their bodies were recovered the next morning. What unfolded in these 24 hours has become a puzzle for the local police. Investigation has unraveled several aspects of the crime, but many parts lack clarity. The police on March 15 arrested one of Chaudhary s bodyguards, Sunil Singh from Bermo in Bokaro. He confessed that the two brothers were murdered at the news channel s office and named one Dharmendra Tiwari, who also happens to be a private bodyguard. Later on March 19, Tiwari surrendered to the police in Ranchi. During interrogation, Tiwari revealed that Chaudhary and his partner MK Singh had planned a script to take away cash from the Agarwal brothers. On the fateful day, MK Singh walked in the office disguised as an Intelligence Bureau IB official and asked the two brothers to hand over the cash they had with them, Tiwari told the police. Chaudhary and Singh had planned to take away the cash by scaring the two brothers. However, when the Agarwal brothers refused to get intimidated by their script, Chaudhary and Singh asked Tiwari to shoot the two brothers dead. Tiwari has confessed of firing three rounds of bullets at the Agarwal brothers, sources said. While the police have not officially commented on the amount of cash the two brothers were carrying, sources said that they had at least Rs.5 lakh cash in their bag. Interrogation has revealed a lot about the case so far. The manhunt is on and the two prime accused will be nabbed soon, said Sujata Vinapani, Ranchi Superintendent of Police. She added that the police will detach the properties owned by Chaudhary and Singh if they do not surrender or get arrested soon. During interrogation, one of the arrested bodyguards Sunil Singh told the police that he and Tiwari had set ablaze mobile phones of Agarwal brothers. The accused had also burnt their own clothes after the coldblooded murder in a bid to ensure that no evidences were recovered from the spot. The police have also recovered the DVR of the CCTV cameras installed in the office. They suspect that Chaudhary and MK Singh are hiding somewhere in neighbouring Bihar.\n",

      "A question is haunting BJD supporters as to whether the party would be able to capture the prestigious Rourkela Assembly seat in this election. The BJD had won the seat in three consecutive terms in 2000, 2004 and 2009, but lost to the BJP in 2014 election. There is a faction and intra rivalry among BJD leaders and workers in the Assembly segment because of which it would be tough for the party to win the seat if a proper neutral candidate is not fielded, feel political observers here. Sharada Nayak, who had switched from Congress to BJD in 2004 and successfully contested in two consecutive elections before losing the seat to the BJP s Dilip Ray in 2014, is an aspirant in this election too. Notably, Nayak was a Minister from 2009 to 2011 until he was removed from the State Cabinet for his alleged involvement in May 29 coup against the CM. Following his removal from the Cabinet, people lost confidence in him and anti incumbency factor also led to his defeat in 2014. Giving ticket to Nayak in 2014 election was a setback for the BJD as well, according to observers. Calling him corrupt on one hand and awarding a party ticket to him on the other was actually a blunder, which was reflected in the result, said Narayan Prasad Das, a senior political observer. Although, Dilip Ray has resigned from the BJP and announced not to contest from Rourkela anymore, still the BJD has to be very cautious to nominate a proper candidate to recapture the seat, he feels. Sharada Nayak, besides his damaged goodwill factor, has not been able to contribute any eye catching development as the Chairman of Rourkela Development Authority, which he had received as a gift from the party supremo after his defeat. Stiff hike of holding tax, defective Sarbakhyama policy and no new housing projects during his tenure have aggravated public's ire against him. Besides, Nayak is also facing tough challenges from the BJD rank and file, as a group of BJD workers under the leadership of former Rourkela Municipality Chairperson Rashmibala Mishra has launched a tirade against him. Under these circumstances, the BJD supremo needs to field a neutral candidate, preferably a new face, who can be able to maintain a balance among the fraction forces for achieving success in the election.\n"

      "A day after the Catholic Church in Kerala transferred four nuns from its Missionaries of Jesus convent in Kuravilangad, Sister Anupama Kelamangalathuveliyil, who has been asked to return to Chamiyari convent in Punjab, called the transfer order an attempt to split and destabilise them . Advertising This is an attempt to split and destabilise us emotionally. No guarantee that people who aren t protecting us here will give us protection at other places like Bihar or Punjab, she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Sister Anupama also denied moving out of the mission house saying she will stay until justice is served. It is not a fresh transfer order, but only a reminder to return to the mission s convents where we had been in the past. We were told to comply with the earlier order issued in March last year in this regard. We all have come to our house in Kottayam to extend support to our sister the rape victim . We will stay here until she gets justice. We have no plan to move out. What security would we get in the convents allotted to us she said. Advertising The other three sisters, Sister Alphy has been transferred to Pakartala convent in Bihar, Sister Josephine to Lalmatia in Jharkhand and Sister Ancita to Kannur in Kerala. Their colleague Neena Rose, who also participated in the protest, has not been issued a transfer order. In September, five nuns of the Missionaries of Jesus mission house in Kottayam staged an indefinite sit in in Kochi, demanding rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal s arrest. The protest had paved the way for a major movement, Save Our Sisters, which was called off only after the arrest of Mulakkal and his removal as bishop of Jalandhar. The letters separately issued to the four nuns by their superior Regina Kadamthottu on January 10 said it was a reminder to them to join convents assigned to them as per the earlier transfer order in March 2018. This is the second such reminder to the nuns after their stand off with authorities. The letter asked the nuns to mend their current way of life and activities pursued by them . The Catholic Church, a week ago, had also sent a warning to Sister Lucy Kalapura, a nun who was at the forefront of protests against rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal, for attending channel discussions , writing articles in non Christian newspapers and making false accusations against the Catholic leadership. The warning, with the threat of dismissal from the congregation, has been issued by Sr. Ann Joseph FCC, Superior General of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation FCC .\n",

      "Veteran journalist and lawyer S Balakrishnan has sought a police inquiry into Maharashtra Navnirman Sena MNS chief Raj Thackeray s claim of another Pulwama like terror attack before the Lok Sabha polls. Balakrishnan Sunday submitted a written complaint to the Chembur police station, demanding an inquiry under relevant laws into the claim made by the MNS chief about a possible terror attack in the country, police said Monday. Citing media reports, Balakrishnan said Thackeray had said, Mark my words there will be yet another Pulwama like incident in the country . According to the application, Thackeray is a senior and responsible politician, whose statements should be taken seriously. He appears to be certain of a repeat of the Pulwama type terror attack that took place on February 14 and resulted in the killing of 40 CRPF jawans in Jammu and Kashmir, the journalist lawyer said. The police should record Thackeray s statement and inquire into his claim, said Balakrishnan. We have received the application of the journalist in connection with the remarks of MNS president Raj Thackeray, said an official of the Chembur police station.\n",

      "Railway police have recovered about 1.5 tonnes of copper wire that was robbed by a gang of over 10 dacoits at Chandil railway station that falls under Adra division of the railway on February 12. The railway police have also arrested two dacoits, including the gang leader Mohammed Rafique 32 , a resident of Mango. The other accused arrested was identified as Anand Kumar Singh alias Badshah 30 , also a resident of Mango. Superintendent railway police SRP , Tatanagar, Ehtesham Waquarib said that it is a big achievement for the police. The robbed copper wire and other copper material have been recovered from a tiled house at Saraswatinagar in Fadlugora village under Chandil area today. As per our probe the criminals had kept the robbed copper wire hidden in the tiled house with a plan for getting the material melted. They had planned to sell out the copper to any scrap dealer later on, said Waquarib. He said they will increase security. The SRP, Tatanagar said that they had earlier arrested four persons involved in the same robbery on February 19 and had recovered a pistol from the possession of one them by carrying out investigation of the robbery jointly by the GRP and railway protection force RPF , Tatanagar. He said those arrested earlier were Athar Ekbal, Mohammed Firoz, Anoop Chakraborty and Manoj Yadav. The SRP said as per their understanding the same gang had robbed railway property from Anara station on February 1. He said the GRP, Anara have been informed about the breakthrough so that they may come and get it verified whether some of the recovered materials had been robbed from there. An official said that several drives have been taken up to spread awareness and posters have been put up at all major stations, urging passengers too to be vigil. In the last few days, several arrests have been made, primarily in the Chakradharpur Division. As per our investigation the gangs used to operate along the Bengal Jharkhand border as the police had jurisdiction problems. We have already got in touch with security officials GRP to evolve a strategy, a senior RPF official said. The criminal had tried to pretext as hawkers and sell drug laced food items. These are not stray incidents and the gangs continue to operate in a certain area for some time. Unlike other criminals, drug and loot gangs have to board trains and befriend victims. This takes some time, said an official.\n",

      "In a sensational incident, three members of a family including the parents and their young daughter were found murdered inside their home in Dabra town of Gwalior district on Friday. The 42 yeaqr old Television mechanic, Brijmohan Goswami, his wife Meenakashi 38 who worked as Aganwadi worker and 20 year old daughter Rekha were found dead inside their home in Dabra. Goswani was found hanging from the ceiling of the house while his wife and daughter were found hacked to death in the house. Rekah whose family lived in Didar colony in Dabra, was to get married next month, locals claimed. The mishap came to light when Brijmohan and his family did not come out of the house this morning and his father accompanied by relatives who live in the other portion of the house, barged into the house by breaking open the door that was bolted from inside. The family members were found dead inside the house under suspicious circumstances. Upon receiving the information, the police rushed to the spot and took bodies into their possession and sent them for autopsy. SDOP Dabra Devendra Kushwah said that the daughter Raksha was to be married next month. Brijmohan alias Pappu regularly used to consume alcohol and often had noisy brawl with wife and daughter. The relatives have confessed to the police that Pappu regularly physically assaulted wife and daughter under the influence of alcohol, said the SDOP. Initial investigation based on the evidences and statements of close relatives and neighbours of the deceased suggests that Pappu could have first murdered wife and daughter with sharp edged objects and later committed suicide by hanging self through the room s ceiling.\n"

      "The probable Congress candidate Geeta Koda from Singhbhum Lok Sabha seat went on meeting spree on Thursday connecting to the party cadres in her constituency. Koda, who is also a legislator from Jagannathpur assembly constituency in West Singhbhum, addressed a series of meetings with her party cardre at Goelkera in West Singhbhum. The parliamentary election is scheduled to be held there on May 12. I am really happy to be connected with party workers. I am holding meetings with the cadres of Jai Bharat Samanta Party as well as the Congress at the village level. I want to understand issues concerning our party workers of Singhbhum Lok Sabha constituency, said the Jagannathpur legislator. Geeta, when questioned said her visit has revamped the spirit of the cadres and I am thrilled to see the response. We are holding meetings at grass root level. It is an important step as the cadres will reach out to the voters spreading party s vision for the area, said the legislator. She, however, prompted to add that her formal campaigning will begin only after she gets officially declared as the Congress candidate for the Singhbhum seat. Wife of former chief minister Madhu Koda, Geeta 35 had successfully contested the 2009 assembly elections on the ticket of Jai Bharat Samanta Party from Jagannathpur. She retained her legislature post of the Jagannathpur assembly seat in November 2014 also on the ticket of Jai Bharat Samanta Party. Incidentally, Geeta joined Congress earlier this year. In 2014, BJP candidate from Singhbhum seat Laxan Gilua had defeated his rival and Jai Bharat Samanta Party JBSP candidate Geeta Koda by a margin of 87476 votes. Gilua had maintained a steady lead in five of the six assembly segments in the Singhbhum Lok Sabha constituency. The JBSP had succeeded to have a mariginal lead over Gilua only in Majhgaon assembly segment in each round till the 10 round. The other five assembly segments where Gilua continued to register his lead were Chaibasa, Jagannathpur, Seraiklea, Chakradharpur and Manoharpur. There were in all 12 candidates in the fray for Singhbhum Lok Sabha seat in 2014 which has 9,57.406 voters. Though she could not win the Singhbhum seat, but she had made a dent in the parliamentary election as she had succeeded to garner over 2,500 votes over Gilua in five out of the six assembly segments of the Singhbhum seat.\n",

      "The accused in the murder of Ganesh Kolhatkar, a Virar based man whose body was chopped up and flushed down the toilet, was sent to judicial custody on Sunday. Police, who were still searching for the motive behind the crime, said Pintu Sharma, the accused, had not been fully cooperating with them during interrogation. Advertising Police said Sharma, who was looking for a job, could not find one despite having some qualifications. He had done some certificate course to take up a job in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, like his father. However, he never landed the job, and kept doing odd jobs like sales and insurance. His last job was as an insurance agent under Arvind Ranade, for whose kidnapping he had been arrested in 2018, said police. He is very coherent when he tells us the details of what happened. And yet, he doesn t share details of his life, except that he has a family, who don t care for him, said an officer from Virar police. He claims that he has given us the complete picture. However, there are loopholes in his story, the officer said. Advertising According to Sharma, Ganesh Kolhatkar was his friend who had borrowed money from him. Kolhatkar had repaid a part of the sum, police said. He maintains that Kolhatkar had come to his house on January 16 for a casual meeting. When Sharma asked about his money, Kolhatkar said he wanted to get married and would need the money for some time, following which Sharma mocked him. An angry Kolhatkar allegedly slipped and knocked himself unconscious. Sharma, thinking he was dead, panicked and killed him with a hacksaw, an officer said. The officer added, But why did he have a hacksaw in a recently rented house that his family knew nothing about and one which wasn t occupied Why did he assume that Kolhatkar was dead He doesn t respond to these questions, or gives different response each time. Born and brought up in Mumbai, Sharma had been living in a ground floor accommodation in Vakola with his wife and two sons for the past 15 years. Despite having a house and not a big income, he had rented flats in Naigaon, Virar and other places in the past, for short durations. This, he said, he didn t share with his family. This seems suspicious. We are trying to identify if he had other sources of income too, an officer privy to investigation said. On Sunday, he was granted judicial custody. We had asked for his custody as our investigation is going on. But the honourable court sent him to jail, said ACP Jayant Bajbale.\n",

      "An Army jawan was killed in a landslide when he was patrolling along the Line of Control LoC in Jammu Kashmir s Baramulla district, Army officials said on Friday. Naik Parvej was leading an operational patrolling team in Baramulla when a landslide struck on Thursday, the officials said. They said the soldier fell into a deep stream flowing along the route and sustained grievous injuries. Parvej was evacuated to 92 Base Hospital here for medical treatment where he died later. The Army Friday paid tribute to Naik Parvej, with Corps Commander KJS Dhillon leading all ranks in paying homage to him. In a show of solidarity, representatives from other security agencies also paid their last respects to the martyr, an Army spokesman said. The 29 year old hailed from Shekhawas village of Rajasthan and he had joined the Army in 2009. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter, he said. The mortal remains of the martyr were flown for last rites to his native place, where he would be laid to rest with full military honours. In this hour of grief, the Army stands in solidarity with the bereaved family and remains committed to their dignity and well being, he added.\n"

When asked, Athagarh PS IIC Padarbinda Tripathy said that he was aware of the incident but nobody has lodged an FIR. Villagers have alleged that the police are intentionally avoiding the case. Earlier on Sunday, some youths had assaulted some VIPs near Chandabali square. As pressure mounted from the police HQ, the Athagarh police arrested the accused persons and forwarded to court. It is also alleged some drunkards are regularly creating unpleasant situations in the town and nearby areas due to inaction of the police. Locals have demanded that the SP direct local police to take action against such miscreants soon.\n",

      "At least 10 young children were trapped when a four storey building collapsed in a densely populated area of Lagos on Wednesday, and rescuers were trying to reach them through the damaged roof. The children were attending a nursery and primary school on the top floor of the residential building when the structure collapsed. Police said they believed scores of people were trapped under the rubble. The incident took place near Itafaji market on Lagos Island at around 10 00 am 0900 GMT . In chaotic scenes, thousands of people thronged the area as police and rescue workers sought to rescue the victims. A young man helping rescue efforts who gave his name only as Derin said at least 10 children were trapped inside but thought to be alive. Police said the overall number of people inside was likely much higher. We are still trying to find out how many are trapped inside but probably scores of people, said police officer Seun Ariwyo. He said at least 20 have been brought out but did not say whether they were alive or dead. An AFP reporter at the scene saw at least eight people pulled from the wreckage, including a small boy with blood on his face. Covered in dust, he was alive but unconscious and appeared to be badly hurt. Building collapses are tragically common in Nigeria, where building regulations are routinely flouted. In September 2014, 116 people, 84 of them South Africans, died when a six storey building collapsed as a celebrity televangelist was preaching. An inquiry found the building had been built illegally and had structural flaws. In December 2016, at least 60 people were killed when a roof fell in on a church in Uyo, the capital of Akwa Ibom state, in the east of the country.\n",

      "Two female elephants of about 30 year age were found dead under mysterious circumstances in the Kuldiha forest range in Baleswar district on Tuesday. The carcasses were sighted near Baliachua Beat II by a patrolling team, said the Range Officer Laxman Pradhan. After bloods were collected, the bodies were burnt late in the night, said Pradhan. He said the blood samples have been sent to laboratories to ascertain whether the pachyderms died due to anthrax or had natural deaths. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained. The pachyderms might have died of old age related ailments. Anthrax infection can t be ruled out. Similipal Tiger Reserve veterinary surgeons have collected blood samples, which have been sent to laboratories to ascertain reasons behind deaths. The bodies were burnt as a precautionary measure, said DFO Biswaraj Panda. In the meantime, a tusker has strayed into the Raibania area and is giving sleepless nights to residents. The tusker, coming from West Bengal jungle, sneaked into Sureisahi village under Baradiha gram panchayat. It has reportedly devoured stored food grains and damaged some dwelling houses of one Hari Singh, said sources. The villagers, in the fear of elephant attack, were guarding their properties throughout the night. They were beating drums, exploding crackers and showing fire balls to the jumbo. They have urged the forest personnel to drive away the elephant and compensate losses.\n"

      "Ranchi Police have arrested one of the two bodyguards of double murder accused Laukesh Choudhary during search operations conducted in Bokaro and recovered a 32 bore revolver used for perpetrating the crime, Senior Superintendent of Police Anish Gupta said on Friday. The murder of brothers Hemant Agarwal and Mahendra Agarwal at the office of a private news channel in Ashok Nagar on March 6 had rocked the State Capital. The family of the deceased businessmen had lodged the first information report with Argora Police Station accusing Choudhary of murdering the two over financial disputes. The arrested bodyguard Sunil Kumar, a resident of Rohtas, has confessed that he and his aid Dharmendra Kumar Tiwari were present at the spot at the time of the murder. During interrogation, he told the police that the duo had set ablaze mobile phones of Agarwal brothers. The accused had also burnt their own clothes after the cold blooded murder in a bid to ensure that no evidences were recovered from the spot. Further interrogation will lead us to more links in the case. A manhunt is on to nab prime accused Laukesh Choudhary, said Gupta. The police, he said, have also recovered DVR of the CCTV camera installed in the office. On the basis of information provided by Kumar, the police also recovered burnt remains of the deceased brothers mobile phones and clothes that Kumar and Tiwari wore during the incident. On the eve of March 7, Mahendra Agarwal and Hemant Agarwal left their residence in Lalpur s Shivam Apartment to meet Choudhary. Their family lodged a complaint with the Lalpur Police Station fearing that the two may have been abducted by Choudhary, the franchise owner of a private news channel. When the police visited the news channel s office on March 7, they found the main door locked and learned that the channel has been shut. Inside the premises of the locked office, police found bodies of Hemant and Mahendra lying in a pool of blood. The two were shot dead and the police suspected that there were at least four more persons present at the spot at the time of the incident. Choudhary, the prime accused in the case, is still absconding.\n",

      "A Thai tycoon accused of poaching a black leopard was sentenced to 16 months in jail on other charges Tuesday but allowed to go free pending an appeal, in a case that has caused an outcry in a country fed up with impunity for powerful figures. Construction magnate Premchai Karnasuta, whose company is behind major infrastructure projects such as Bangkok's monorail and its airport, was arrested by rangers in a national park in February 2018. He and three others were detained after rangers stumbled upon their campsite and found guns and animal carcasses, including a Kalij pheasant, a red muntjac or barking deer and the pelt of a black leopard. While Premchai was found not guilty of possessing a leopard carcass, he was convicted of three other poaching related charges. The verdict, handed out in a statement to reporters waiting at Thong Pha Phum courthouse, said Premchai was sentenced altogether to 16 months . Two others caught with him his driver and cook received lesser sentences, while his hunting guide was sentenced to three years and five months. A court official said the tycoon was immediately released on bail of 400,000 Thai baht USD 12,600 as he was not considered a flight risk. Thai courts sometimes grant bail immediately to a convicted person in the expectation they will appeal, and Premchai's lawyer later confirmed he would challenge the verdict. The sentence comes less than a week before a general election on March 24, the first polls since the junta seized power in 2014 vowing to expunge graft and uphold the rule of law. After Premchai's arrest, the striking images of the skinned leopard went viral, inspiring protests that saw demonstrators don black leopard masks, as well as graffiti of the cat across city walls and a Change.Org petition calling for an investigation. Park ranger Vichaen Chinnawing, who arrested the businessman and has been hailed as a hero in Thai media, said he was satisfied with the conviction. I have done my best in this case. If the soul of the dead leopard knows, it will be grateful, he told AFP. Arrests and convictions for poaching happen often in Thailand but they are rare when it comes to prominent individuals. Thai media followed every detail of the case, including the authorities' investigation of human faeces found at the scene and a raid on Premchai's home where police uncovered a stash of ivory and guns. It struck a chord with everyone who sees a double standard in the country's law enforcement, said Human Rights Watch's Sunai Phasuk. Premchai is the president of the publicly traded Italian Thai Development, a Bangkok based company that helped build Thailand's Suvarnabhumi airport and the city's skytrain public transit system known as the BTS. Alhough he was listed as one of Thailand's 50 richest people by Forbes in 2016, he dropped off the list the following year as the government delayed infrastructure spending. Requests for comment from Premchai's company were refused.\n",

      "Afzal Kohistani, a man at the centre of a campaign to expose one of Pakistan s most notorious honour killings cases has been shot dead in the garrison city of Abbottabad, media reports said Thursday. Advertising In 2012, Kohistani emerged as one of the first Pakistanis to violate a local custom in remote northern Kohistan district where matters of family honour are settled in blood. Those perceived to have violated the code are killed with the mutual consent of families involved. Afzal was shot dead on Wednesday night in a busy commercial area of the north western city of Abbottabad, police said, quoting witnesses to the killing. He suffered multiple injuries and died on the spot, they said. He was shot by unidentified gunmen who managed to flee. Advertising According to Station House Officer Ghafoor, of the Cantt police station, Afzal was accompanied by his nephew at the time of the incident. The nephew shot back at the gunmen and remained unhurt. Afzal s death comes amid a blood feud that has also seen three of his other brothers killed in 2013, Dawn news reported. About 1,000 honour killings of women by relatives are recorded each year in Pakistan, say human rights activists. According to the custom, the male family members of a woman suspected of an out of wedlock liaison should first kill the woman, and then go after the man. The family of the man would not oppose this action. The Kohistan video scandal made headlines in 2012 when eight boys and girls were killed by members of their tribe after a mobile phone video of them at a wedding in a remote village in Kohistan emerged on social media. The video showed five females singing and clapping along as the male family members danced. The mixed gathering had taken place in a village located in an extremely conservative part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In the eyes of the local people, the youngsters had violated tribal norms and brought dishonour upon them. After the video was leaked, a jirga was held by the girls tribe which decreed the killing of the boys and girls under riwaj a tribal custom .\n"

      "The sanitation workers of Municipal Corporation of Dehradun MCD have decided to oppose the civic body s decision to appoint such workers through outsourcing. Notably, the decision was taken at the board meeting held on Thursday. The members of the sanitation workers union said that the move was unjustified. We would fight it to the last, they warned. Speaking on the matter, a member of the body and councillor of ward number 24 Shivaji Marg Vishal said, Our workers have been working in MCD for many years. They have spent half of their life working for the civic body. This despite the fact they are not even regular employees. Their salary was raised only after we staged a vehement protest for nearly 12 days. He further said, Our only demand is that no sanitation worker should be appointed through outsourcing. We presented our opinion at the board meeting as well and many councillors agreed. The officials, however, said that many of the workers are skipping duty. We have suggested that the councillors should be made the in charges of the sanitation workers. This would ensure the presence of the sanitation workers in their assigned areas. However, we would not agree to such workers being recruited through outsourcing.\n",

      "Fire gutted many electrical equipment and other articles in the house allotted to deputy leader of Congress legislature party in State Assembly Karan Mahra in the MLA hostel here. Fortunately, the residence of the congress leader was locked at the time fire broke out. In a glaring example of questionable safety measures taken in a place which supposedly is a high security zone the incident of fire didn t came into the notice of the authorities. Interestingly, a fire alarm that was installed only recently also played truant when the fire broke out. The incident came to notice on Monday when Mahra entered his residence which was locked since March 8. Mahra found that the bed, mattresses, air conditioner, refrigerator, some files and other gadgets were burned by the fire. On March 8, I left the house and on March 9, the house was opened by staff for installation of an air conditioner. The fire probably broke out on the night of 9th or on 10th. The fire alarm placed just near a wall clock which too got burned completely in the fire could not raise any alarm, It shows gross negligence on the part of the authorities responsible to security, maintenance and safety of the MLA hostel, he said. Incidentally this incident is not an isolated case of fire, some months ago a similar incidence of fire was reported by Kedarnath MLA, Manoj Rawat. On the complaint of Rawat, the speaker of Uttarakhand Assembly Prem Chand Agarwal has inspected the hostel and given necessary orders to the authorities. When contacted, Estate Officer, Banshidhar Tiwari said that prime facie, the incident appears as a case of fire caused by an electrical short circuit. On question of failure of the fire alarm, he said that a committee consisting of Executive Engineer, Civil, Executive Engineer, Electrical, Chief Fire Officer and Security Officer of the MLA hostel has been constituted to investigate the incident. Tiwari said that the committee has been asked to submit its report on Tuesday.\n",

      "Unlike other Assembly seats, the BJD seems to have an easygoing exercise in selecting a candidate for the Banki Assembly constituency in view of a few but worthy aspirants seeking the party ticket for the seat. A leading cooperative movement and social activist, lawyer Mahendra Kumar Nayak, is an aspirant for the seat. Awarded at national, State and district levels for his contribution to the cooperative sector and having been in people contact as a social activist and as a BJD observer to Banki block for long, Nayak has offered his candidature for the seat. Sources said Nayak and incumbent MLA Pravat Tripahty are never at loggerheads and they would work to retain the seat if either of them gets the ticket. In fact, Nayak seeks a ticket in case Tripathy is not fielded this time. Nayak, a son of noted freedom fighter late Bholanath Nayak, had done his schooling and college education at Banki. He worked in many capacities with national, State and district level cooperate bodies for the last 40 years, the major being Nafed as president , National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India Gujarat as director , Krishak Bharati Cooperative Ltd as elected State respresentative and Odisha State Cooperative Bank Ltd as president . He is presently working as the president of the Odisha Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and Credit Cooperative Societies Ltd. He is also lifetime member of different reputed organisations like Red Cross Society of India, Youth Hostel Association of India, Odisha Cricket Association and the Odisha High Court Bar Association.

      "Police resorted to lathicharge as a farmers agitation against limestone mining by a private firm in Mahuva taluka of Bhavnagar district turned violent on Wednesday, leaving at least four policemen and as many farmers injured in the clash. Advertising Around 2,000 residents from nearby areas assembled at Uncha Kotda village in the taluka Wednesday to protest against ongoing mining of limestone by UltraTech Cement Limited from its Bambhor Talli mining site. As the farmers started marching towards the mining site, police stopped them, leading to a clash. While the policemen deployed on the mining site were trying to persuade farmers to return , they turned violent and started pelting stones on police teams. A sub inspector and three constables sustained serious injuries in the stone pelting. The mob also targeted eight police vehicles and vandalised them. In order to control the rioters, we lobbed 35 teargas shells and resorted to lathicharge. In the lathicharge, four protesters were injured, Superintendent of Police of Bhavnagar, Pravin Mal, told The Indian Express. Later, farmers clashed again with the police outside Datha police station where around 45 protesters, including their leader Bharat Bhil, were brought after they were detained. The farmers assembled outside the police station demanding release of the detained protesters. Police had to use force again to disperse rioting mobs. We have detained around 80 persons, including 35 women. We are in the process of registering two cases for rioting and other offences, and these persons will be formally arrested once the FIRs are lodged, Mal said. According to the police, the cement company suspended mining operations following the clashes. This is second major protest by farmers of 12 villages of Mahuva and Talaja against limestone mining in as many months.\n",

      "Shanila Sajesh and Reshma Nishanth protest as they were stopped by police and protesters near Neelimala on Wednesday. Pampa Two young women pilgrims to Sabarimala, Reshma Nishanth, 30, and Shanila Sajesh, 28, were forced to trek down by the police and protesters after a three and half hour high voltage drama here early Wednesday morning. Three protesters stopped them along with their seven male friends near Neelimala, a point in the traditional trekking path from Pampa, at 4.20 am. As the report spread, over 50 protesters, mainly non Malayalis, thronged at the spot, blocking their movement. The women sat down on the trekking path asking the police for help to move ahead. Police refused and turned them back, saying the mob could become violent if they move forward. However, the women argued with police that they had undergone strict penance of 41 days and they came as absolute devotees. They insisted that they must have darshan. Ms Nishanth told reporters that it was a police lapse that made the situation tense. There were only three protesters initially, she said. Police restricted our journey so that more protesters could gather. They said they wouldn't take off the holy beads wore as part of penance till they had a darshan of Lord Ayyappa. As the situation turned vicious, the policewomen took them forcibly to their vehicles. The violent mob started throwing broken coconut shells at the moving police vehicles. Many punched on windshields shouting at the women inside. The police took them to an undisclosed location. The women said the police had agreed to shield them before their journey took off. But, no officials confirmed this. Ms Prashant, a research fellow in Kerala's temple cultures, was among the first women below 50 who expressed desire of going to Sabarimala soon after the Supreme Court lifted age restrictions last year. She used to be active on social media seeking support for her cause. She was also in the centre of news when right wing groups intimidated her offline and online for her attempt to worship there. They are also active members in a Facebook page Navodhana Keralam Sabarimalaikku Renaissance Kerala towards Sabarimala under the same banner Kanakadurga, Bindu Ammini and Manju broke the barriers earlier this month. R. Aditya, superintendent of police, Pampa in charge, told DC that there was no lapse on their part. He said anyone could come and go and police bandobast was everywhere. Responding to women's claim of the promise of security, he said that allegation was baseless. Police initially held five protesters for obstructing them but took no serious step to disperse people mobbing them. Police seemed more restraint as the prohibitory order in Sabarimala and surrounding areas including Pampa was not extended, since the Makaravilakku festival got over on Monday.\n"

      "After declaration of candidates in some of the constituencies by BJP and Congress, rebels have emerged from within the party causing headache for the leaders. The situation has come to such a pass that parties seem to put more faith on migrating leaders than its own cadre workers. Discontentment among the aspiring candidates who have been denied tickets is the main reason for split between party supporters. The former BJD MLA of Anandpur and former contractor Bhagirathi Sethy who joined BJP has been declared the nominee for Anandpur seat by the BJP much to the discontentment of cadre party workers. Senior Congress leader Jayadev Jena who is the Congress nominee from Anandpur is ready to take advantage of the situation and give a strong fight to the BJD. Prithviraj Kuanr, the former Congress MLA nominee of Ghasipura joined the BJP and has been in constant touch with party workers and voters since the last 5 years. He is the BJP nominee for Ghasipura and is ready to fight with senior BJD leader and Minister Badrinarayan Patra who is expected to be the party candidate here. But other BJP aspirants are planning to sabotage Prithvi s prospects, sources said. Ghasipura is also the all time constituency of PCC president Niranjan Patnaik but BJD leader Patra has succeeded in fielding him out in the last two elections. After declaration of Bidyadhar Dehury s name as the Congress candidate for Keonjhar Assembly seat, other party aspirants like Sidhu Naik are planning to file nominations as independents from the seat. Declaration of senior BJP leader Mohan Majhi from Keonjhar Assembly seat has created discontentment among other aspirants like Kiranbala Naik etc who rushed to the district party office with their supporters to vent their anger. The supporters of Akhila Naik, who joined BJP recently aspiring for Patna Assembly ticket, thronged into the party office damaging furniture and assets after senior cadre leader Bhawani Naik was declared party candidate. Party aspirants Momita Naik and Dasmati Chattar from BJP are unhappy with the candidate selection. Former Congress MLA from Champua Dhanurjay Sidhu who joined BJP has been made BJP nominee for Telkoi seat leading to disgruntlement among local party workers. His close aide cum business partner Jadumani Barik has been given a Congress ticket from Champua seat where sitting Independent MLA Sanatan Mahakud is expected to be a deciding factor here. BJP MP candidate Ananta Nayak is also facing resistance from his own party leaders who were aspirant for the ticket. Sukeshi Oram, Dr Fakir Nayak and others were the aspirants. Some leaders have announced to fight independently to see Anant Nayak gets defeated in the elections.\n"

      "In a bizarre incident, interns as well as students of MGM Medical College and Hospital assaulted two police officials on duty after keeping them hostage at the MGM Medical College in Dimna in the wee hours of Sunday. The two police officers, OC, Ulidih police station Chandrashekhar Kumar and SI, Pankaj Singh were rescued after superintendent of police City Prabhat Kumar resorted to a mild lathicharge at the medical college early this morning. Police latter, arrested an intern of MGM Medical College Hospital after he, along with 40 others resorted to violence. After the incident, principal, MGM Medical College A Akhauri has set up a probe committee comprising the heads of the departments and wardens of the medical college to probe into the incident that led a section of college students and junior doctors to clash with the police. The fight started after a team of police officials were carrying out anti crime checking in front of the Ulidih police station on Dimna Road in Mango. DSP Patamda Vijay Mahto said that the police team led by OC, Chandrashekhar Kumar was stopping each and every car for checking in view of the ensuing Lok Sabha elections. As the drive was on, a car was coming from Sakchi and as the police officials tried to stop it, the four wheeler did not stop and escaped away, leading the OC, police to chase it, suspecting something wrong, said Mahto. The DSP said as the car entered into the medical college campus, the cops too entered and asked the occupants of the car to allow them to search. Both youths who were in the car refused to obey their instructions and instead called in other students from the hostel. About 40 students came there and took the two police officials into a hostel room where they assaulted them together, the DSP said. According to sources, before taking the police officials to the hostel, the students had locked the entrance gate and had switched off the lights of the campus. As the news spread the City SP led a district police and entered into the hostel and finally rescued the two cops after resorting to mild lathi charge. When the two cops were rescued, they were bleeding by their face and nose, beside other injuries in their bodies. DSP, Mahto said by the time the police team reached the medical college campus most of the students had fled but three were caught. Among the three was Rishabh Kumar who was leading the medical students in assaulting the cops.\n",

      "Local MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain who leads the Athagrah seat for the last 28 years is facing challenges from the young contenders of the same party here. The young cadres are seen more active in party organisation and getting huge support from the rank and file in the BJD. Two such young leaders are Manash Bastia and Abhaya Barik. According to the talk going round here, they have got green signal from the Third Floor CM s Office to organise the party here and are said to be strong contenders of BJD tickets. Though the picture is still not clear as to who would be given the BJD ticket for Athagarh, still the supporters of Bastia and Barik are seen aggressively engaged in organising the party by challenging Swain. Meanwhile, it is also said that if Basatia and Barik are not given ticket by the BJD, they may throw their weight behind Congress or BJP and divert the BJD votes. However, the duo maintained that they are in regular touch with Cuttack district BJD president Pratap Jena and CM s Personal Secretary VK Pandian for getting ticket. Time will decide the fate of the trio, say the local political analysts here.\n",

All the injured, including the driver have been admitted at the MGM Medical College Hospital. Sources said heavy vehicles coming out of industrial units of Adityapur are the worst offenders. Instead of keeping left and then taking a U turn after a kilometre or so, these trucks hurtle down the wrong side, facing oncoming traffic and risking the lives of hundreds on two or four wheelers. There are no traffic rules on the road. Drivers have to be alert throughout the stretch and dodge vehicles coming from the wrong side, said a senior official of Gamharia based company. He said that the administration must work out on a mechanism for streamlining the traffic system. Heavy vehicles coming out of industrial units are the worst offenders. A strict vigil must be kept on the movement.\n"

      "Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Saturday criticised JDS and Congress leaders for organising a protest outside the Income Tax Office at Bengaluru for conducting searches on PWD contractors and engineers. Stating that the disproportionality of the reaction of the Congress and the JDS raises a needle of suspicion, Jaitley said If no politician has been searched, no minister has been searched, then why the protest The Bengaluru case is a text book method of the UPA on 2 fronts use government money, round trip it through contractors and beneficiaries to enrich themselves and then lip sympathy for federalism destroying it whenever the opportunity arises. This is a very transparent self goal, Jaitley said in his blog titled 'The UPA makes corruption a cause'. Led by Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, the Congress JDS ruling combine organised a protest in front of the Income Tax department at Bengaluru on Thursday against a statewide crackdown on his partymen and others. Jaitley said that it was unprecedented that the chief minister of a state joined the street protest against income tax searches with a political motivation. The disproportionality of the reaction of the Congress and the JDS raises a needle of suspicion. Was the minister's nephew a PWD contractor to whom largesses have been given a case of nepotism The CM and the ministers who joined the protest need to answer these questions, Jaitley said. Even as the JDS and Congress leaders in the state alleged that ministers had been searched, the best evidence they could provide for was that the nephew' of a minister was searched, Jaitley said, adding that even the tax authorities have issued a statement saying that no MP, MLA or minister was searched. Questioning whether states' attitude is threat to federalism, Jaitley said federalism is not merely the rights of the states. Indian federalism entails India as a union of states . The rights of the union are equally important. Security of India, sovereignty, dealing with terrorism, managing the borders, custom check points, income tax enforcement are all amongst the several constitutional powers of the union. If the states stand in way of any of them it is guilty of breaching federal norms. Can a state barge its police into the customs area and direct the customs as to what is to be done This would be a threat to federalism, he said. Jaitley said many states have stopped giving police security to income tax authorities when they conduct their operations. Alternatively, when state police is asked for, the information is leaked out to the political government and it reaches the targets of the operations. Tax authorities increasingly have to rely on central forces. In the Kashmir valley recently, searches were conducted under the governor's rule after 17 years. These taxes are meant for the welfare of the poor in India, he added.\n",

      "The BJD party workers of Umarkote are excited as sitting two time MLA Subash Gond has been renominated for the upcoming polls. After the announcement of his name by party supremo and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, the local BJD workers in thousand went to Gond s resident and greeted his family members. Gond, a close associate of slain MLA Jagabandhu Majhi, was handpicked by the BJD and fielded as its nominee during the by election to the Umarkote Assembly constituency. He was the vice president of the Dalit Samaj headed by former MLA Jagabandhu before he merged it with the BJD. Besides having good network of workers because of his close proximity to Jagabandhu, Gond had his own sphere of influence as the vice president of the Dalit Samaj. He has got great applause for his various public friendly initiatives which made him the MLA of Umarkote twice, said local leader of BJD Parsuram Patro. The party supremo has reposed faith on him and nominated him once again to serve the people of the constituency, Patro added. There was a speculation of BJD fielding a new face as in the last panchayat election, the performance of the BJD in Umarkote constituency under the leadership of Gond was found dismal. Sanraj Gond who is presently a Sarapanch in Raighar block was also in the race for a BJD ticket from the seat. However, BJD leaders raised sloganeering protesting Sanraj in a party meeting held at Sirliguda headed by Sanjay Das Burma, the district observer of BJD. They warned that a change of nominee would be a dangerous move. Pramad Padhy, a senior BJD leader of the district, said, The general elections are different from the Panchayat election. Due to the influence of the BJP led Chhattisgarh Government then, the BJP performed well in the Panchayats adjacent to the Chhattisgarh border. But now the situation is different in Chhattisgarh. So this time, the BJD will perform well in the bordering areas.\n",

      "Ropar Police has arrested three gangsters of Pehalwan group, allegedly involved in five cases of highway dacoity, including a national level weightlifter. Four of their accomplices are still at large.

Former Narla MLA Kumarmani Sabar, ex Junagarh MLA Gobardhan Dash, ex Dharmagarh MLA Jugaram Behera and other leaders holding various posts in the party submitted a joint resignation letter to Pradesh Congress Committee PCC head Niranjan Patnaik. In the resignation letter, the leaders said, We had been working to strengthen the Indian National Congress for two decades. However, we were ignored and sidelined by the party during selections of candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. While two members of a family were given party tickets, the senior leaders, who have been serving the party for decades, were denied the tickets. Despite repeated protests by the party workers, we were ignored by the PCC, they alleged in the letter indicating all s not well in the party. They mentioned the alleged partiality in ticket disbursement for the Narla constituency and candidates selection for Kalahandi district as a whole. There was demand for a long term leadership in the Narla constituency.

      "Till March last year, Adil Ahmad Dar 20 , a resident of Gundibagh village in Pulwama district of South Kashmir, used to work in a sawmill. On Thursday, the Jaish e Mohammad named him as the suicide bomber behind the attack on the CRPF convoy. Advertising VIDEO Modi says terrorists will pay for Pulwama attack, Oppn backs govt According to reports, Adil left his home on March 19, 2018, and didn t return. His friend, Sameer Ahmad, a post graduate student of Geology at Kashmir University, went missing the same day. Adil s family filed a missing person report at the local police station. But their search ended a few days later, when his photograph was posted on social networking sites, holding an AK 47 and with the code name Waqas Commando . In a pre recorded video message released by the Jaish after the suicide attack on Thursday, Adil said he had joined its fidayeen squad. This was just two months after a local militant, Fardeen Ahmad Khanday 16 , was killed in an attack on a CRPF camp at Lethpora. Advertising Adil, whose father, Ghulam Hassan Dar, is a small time vendor, dropped out of Class XII and started to work at a sawmill owned by a neighbour. Till he left to join militancy last March. After leaving home, he met us only once, Dar told The Indian Express. His cousin was a militant, who was killed just 11 days after joining them, he said. According to his family, Adil was shot in the leg when he took part in the protests that rocked the Valley following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in 2016. It is bad that people from both sides are being killed, said Dar. The politicians are playing politics and not addressing the problem. They should try to find out why the youth are picking up the gun and are ready to take such an extreme step, he said. In January last year, two local militants from Pulwama Fardeen Ahmad Khanday and Manzoor Baba were killed during an attack on a CRPF camp at Lethpora.\n",

      "The police lodged a case against State Education and Sports minister Arvind Pandey and 18 other persons named in the case apart from more than 100 unnamed persons after the police post in charge of Kundeshwari was allegedly manhandled. The incident occurred in presence of the cabinet minister when those involved in the mining and transport business protested against the police after four vehicles transporting quarried materials were seized. According to sources, a large crowd of people aggravated after the police seized the vehicles congregated at the Kundeshwari police post. Some of them reportedly not only verbally abused the police post in charge but also manhandled him. The police officer had to lock himself in a room for protection from the crowd. The situation improved after senior police officers reached the site. The high voltage drama of those involved in the mining business in the presence of the cabinet minister continued for about half an hour. It is pertinent to mention here that some time ago, on allegations of illegal collection, the senior superintendent of police, Barinderjit Singh had reverted the then Kundeshwari police post in charge to the police line. Arjun Giri Goswami was then posted as the in charge of this police post. However, those involved in the mining business have been alleging that the police have been acting autocratically in the area. Vehicles are being seized without proper grounds and people are being manhandled, they further alleged. Irked at this, the members of the mining business fraternity congregated on Tuesday and held a meeting in which they expressed their objection to the functioning of the police. From here, they along with the cabinet minister Arvind Pande, walked to the Kundeshwari police post. They reportedly became angry on sighting Goswami and in the presence of the cabinet minister also resorted to manhandling the police officer. The sub inspector managed to lock himself up in a small room to protect himself from the irate crowd. He did not come out of the room until senior police officers also reached the site. While the education minister expressed dissatisfaction at the functioning of the police post in charge, the senior officers assured that this would be probed into. Talking to this correspondent on the phone, the additional superintendent of police, Jagdish Chandra said that based on CCTV footage, a case had been registered against 19 persons including the cabinet minister and 100 other unnamed persons for obstructing government work, violating model code of conduct and section 144. Four persons have also been arrested under various sections by the police.Meanwhile, those involved in the mining and transport business are planning to protest against the police on Wednesday.\n",

      "Of late, Maoists in Odisha are facing serious leadership crisis as senior leaders are showing lethargy and lack of interest in organising the activities, which has turned out to be a major concern for the ultras. With large scale operations taken up by security forces in the Left Wing Extremist LWE affected zones and over a dozen senior ultras having been eliminated during last year, other senior cadres are feeling the heat and showing reluctance to lead the team. The Odisha State Committee of the CPI Maoist is now facing a double whammy with loss of senior leaders and lack of recruitment of young cadres. Senior leaders facing health issues and age related problems are leaving the forests and far flung forest zones, while opting for urban areas for their personal wellbeing. So strength of the Maoist organisation is weakening and there is hardly any leader to take up the challenge, reveal senior IPS officers, engaged in anti Maoist operations. The Odisha police, Central security forces and Greyhound of Andhra Pradesh are targeting the senior cadres and they have been successful in eliminating to a large extent. Due to joint operations, more and more senior cadres of Maoists are facing the heat, which is resulting as dampener and it is leading to weakening of the State organization. DGP Rajendra Prasad Sharma who has stepped up anti insurgency operation in the cut off areas after Gurupriya bridge was opened has by now weakened the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee AOBSZC . Though the organization is still active in Andhra Odisha Border, its influence is dwindling fast due to loss of senior cadres, arms and ammunitions. Greyhounds of Andhra Pradesh has also turned nightmare for the Maoist as it is specifically targeting senior leaders and elimination of these cadres have weakened the ultra organisation active in the neighbouring areas of the State. So there is a perceptible decline in Maoist activities in the Red corridor and senior leaders are in no mood to reach out to the young cadres. Another issue, which is weakening the Maoist base is that there is a wide gap between senior cadres of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. As there is hardly any recruitment in Odisha, young cadres are roped in from Chhattisgarh, who have the language problem to deal with Telugu speaking cadres. More pertinently, hyperactive IPS officer, Himanshu Lal, known for his aggressive approach, is leading the front as DIG in South Western Range, which is hot bed of the Maoists. This has boosted the morale of the State police and District Voluntary Forces deployed in this region.\n"

      "The National Investigation Agency NIA on Saturday arrested an operative of Pakistan based terror group Jaish e Mohammed in connection with the 2017 terror attack on a CRPF camp in South Kashmir. Syed Hilal Andrabi, 35, of Jammu Kashmir s Pulwama district, was produced before a court which sent him to five days police custody. According to NIA, he was arrested from Jammu by the NIA in connection with the attack on the CRPF camp at Lethpora in South Kashmir on December 30 night in 2017, in which five personnel were killed.

An active over ground worker of the JeM, Andrabi is a key conspirator who provided logistic support in the form of sheltering the terrorists and conducting reconnaissance of the CRPF group centre before the attack, the NIA said. Andrabi s arrest came days after Nisar Ahmed Tantray, whose brother Noor Trali is believed to have helped revive the JeM in Jammu and Kashmir, was arrested by the NIA after being deported from the UAE in the same case. NIA said that with the arrest of Andrabi, total no of accused arrested in this case has risen to four. Earlier last month, the NIA arrested Fayaz Ahmed Magray from Pulwama for allegedly being the key conspirator of the 2017 attack and accused him of providing logistical support such as shelter to the militants and conducting reconnaissance of the CRPF Group Centre, Lethpora before the attack.

      "nTwo days after members of a family were beaten up in Gurugram s Dhamaspur village by a group of men tension continues to prevail in the area on Sunday even as police arrested two of the accused. The accused have been identified as 24 year old Mahesh Kumar and Dhirender alias Dheere, both are resident of Naya Gaon, a village located barely 2 km from Dhamaspur. Sources in police confirmed that two more people have been detained and are being questioned. A senior police official said that Mahesh Kumar was apprehended from Bhondsi on Friday evening. The official said that all the accused have been identified who were involved in the crime. Efforts are on to nab them, he said. A team of senior police officers are closely investigating the matter. The probe teams are on the job and we will arrest more of the accused soon. The incident is highly sensitive but not communal. I will appeal to all not to spread rumours and disrupt peace. A Police Control Room PCR van has been stationed outside the victim s house. No further violence has been reported from the area, said Police Commissioner, Muhammad Akil. Though the district police have arrested one of the culprits, tension still prevails in the area that has been converted into a fortress with heavy deployment of police force. The local panchayat is reportedly mediating between the two families for a compromise. We were assured of a speedy investigation and quick action by the city police, but only one person has been arrested so far. We have warned police that if more progress is not made and more people are not apprehended, we will reach the Police Commissioner s office on Monday to demand action, said a member of the Muslim Ekta Manch, which has been assisting the victim s family. The incident took place after some of the accused allegedly approached the boys from the family, who were playing cricket outside, and demanded that they go to Pakistan and play . According to the FIR, the incident took place around 5 pm, at the home of Mohammad Sajid, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and has been living here for the last three years with his wife Sameena and six children. In the complaint, Sajid s nephew Dilshaad, who was among those beaten up, said the trouble started when he was playing cricket with some others in a vacant plot near the house. Two unknown men came on a bike and hurled communal abuses. An argument started when they asked our boys to go and play cricket in Pakistan. They began fighting and when my uncle Sajid intervened, the boy sitting at the back of the bike slapped him. Later a mob of drunken men came to our home and attacked us with bhalas spears , lathis sticks and talwars swords . On seeing them, we ran into the house, and they all began demanding that the men come out or they will kill us. When we did not go out, they forced their way into the house and started beating us up, he alleged. In the minutes that followed, one of the family members shot the entire attack on his mobile phone and soon the video became viral on social media. We are planning to either move back to our village or to Delhi. If this has happened here once, it can happen again. Even if something like this happens in our village, at least we will have 15 20 people who will stand by us. We are feeling alone here, said Mohammad Sajid, the victim. A case has been registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code IPC including an attempt to murder at the Bhondsi Police Station. Further probe into the matter is underway. We are conducting raids and expect to make arrests soon, said Subhash Boken, spokesperson of the Gurugram police.\n",

      "In a queer turn of incident, about 68 students appearing at the 2 science examination of the CHSE, lodged a protest against the college authorities demanding to do malpractice. Denied, they created a ruckus and held a dharna. The incident has happened at Deogarh. As per information, 2 Science examination was underway on Tuesday in a college in the top floor of its building under surveillance of CC TV cameras. However, a few minutes after the examination commenced, about 68 students, including 24 girls and 44 boys, stopped writing and came down to the ground floor, sat in the veranda and wrote the examination using all unfair means. Neither did they listen to the invigilators on duty nor to the Principal. I was compelled to inform the matter to the Collector and SP who immediately rushed in to the college. They also convinced the students to write the examination as per the provisions, but in vain, told Principal Santoshini Satapathy. Consequently, the answer sheets of the students were seized and their roll numbers were taken, besides their signatures by the Collector and the SP. Since, all the students have been booked under malpractice, it is Education Department to decide whether they can appear at the next examinations or not, said Collector Sudhansu Mohan Samal. However, deputy secretary of CHSE Uttam Pradhan said the students would be allowed to appear at the next papers if they agree to obey the rules and maintain discipline like other colleges.\n"

      "Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir J K got a huge shot in the arm with the arrest of Owais Amin, a Hizbul Mujahideen terror operative behind Saturday's March 30 failed car suicide bomb attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama. According to top level sources, the suspect was arrested not too far away from the abortive attack site. He was found on the National Highway in a car when he was apprehended last night. Amin, in his early 20s, was studying BBA in a Srinagar college, when he joined the terror ranks last year. He had a clean slate with no case. Amin was studying BBA in a Srinagar college Amin, originally a resident of South Kashmir s Shopian, was found injured on the National Highway, with injuries behind his ear and on right hand. Sources said he got injured as he tried to trigger the blast. Sources said Owais has been shifty when questioned by security forces. He first claimed that he was abducted by a group of 14 15 armed Hizb militants, whose faces were covered. He was asked to launch the suicide attack. On further questioning, he said he was given Rs 1 lakh to launch Pulwama attack. Intelligence agencies and J K Police are not so far buying any of his statements as they seem he is cooking up some of the statements. New trend While the priority is to treat him in Ramban and then take him to Jammu. Only on sustained interrogation will we know the truth, a top source told India Today TV. Moreover, sources feel that Amin is part of the new crop of silent recruitment underway in Kashmir Valley people who have no past link with any terror group. Detection of these recruits will be difficult with no evidence, no viral photos, no social media post. A recruit with the clean slate would be harder to detect. For the attack, he said to have got in touch with the Lashkar e Taiba commander Rayeez Ahmed. Sources said unlike the February 14 Pulwama terror attack where planning was done in Pakistan, in this case, the planning and plotting seems to have been done locally. This is a major worry for security forces as they prepare for the Lok Sabha polls. The car that was involved in the failed operation was fitted with two LPG cylinders one of 15 kg, the other of 5 kg it also had petrol, a 9 volt battery, a jerry can filled with suspected nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, gelatin sticks, urea and sulphur basic ingredients to make an improvised explosive device IED . The material were locally procured and executed by a local terror operative. The car, a Hyundai Santro, had fake number plates. It is said to be from Haryana and most likely stolen. The chassis number and engine number were found to be a mismatch. The attack is being seen as a security lapse by officials. Replaying the attack The low intensity blast inside the private car took place on Jammu Srinagar highway, near the Jawahar Tunnel, when a 33 convoy carrying 200 CRPF soldiers was passing by. The car hit a CRPF bus from the rear at around 10.25 am. The bus belonged to the 54th Battalion. The 10 personnel on board had a lucky escape as the plan for a Pulwama like attack failed. The only damage to the bus was the broken rear glass windows. The car caught fire as the cylinders exploded. Owais escaped into a hamlet. A two page note was recovered from the car however, security forces said that they are investigating whether it was planted after the blast. In the note, Amin owned up to the attack, but sources said seemed to have chickened out at the last minute. Amin specifically referred to the youngest pellet gun victim, Hiba Nissar, and Kashmiri teacher Rizwan Asad Pandit who died in police custody on March 19. The note vowed to avenge atrocities committed by the security forces. A team from the National Investigation Agency NIA visited the spot on Sunday. Meanwhile, the director general of CRPF RR Bhatnagar also rushed to Jammu. The incident comes a month after the February 14 suicide attack on a CRPF convoy which saw the worst casualty of security forces with over 40 soldiers being killed.

The assault came hours after the Taliban announced the start of Operation Fath, the name the militants have given to this year s spring offensive. Both sides have sustained casualties, the Afghan defence ministry said. Clashes are ongoing between Afghan security forces and Taliban terrorists. The Taliban, who frequently exaggerate numbers, claimed to have killed or wounded more than 200 soldiers, police and militias . Nangarhar provincial governor spokesman Ataullah Khogyani said two Afghan troops had been killed, along with 27 Taliban fighters. Another Taliban attack was reported around the edges of the northern city of Kunduz, which the militants briefly captured in 2015. Naeem Mangal, head of the Kunduz regional hospital, told AFP at least eight people were killed and 62 wounded. In Ghor province in the west, at least seven Afghan security forces were killed in a Taliban ambush, Ghor provincial governor spokesman Abdul Hai Khatibi told AFP.

      "The Supreme Court Wednesday said it was conscious of the gravity of the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid land dispute and the outcome of mediation on the body politic of the country. A five judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said the case was not only about property but also about sentiment and faith. It is not only about property. It is about mind, heart and healing, if possible, the bench also comprising Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer said. We are not concerned about what Mughal ruler Babur had done and what happened after. We can go into what exists in the present moment, the bench said. The apex court is considering whether the dispute can be settled through mediation. The top court had asked the contesting parties to explore the possibility of amicably settling the decades old dispute through mediation, saying it may help in healing relations .

      "A motorcycle was set ablaze and the school bus was vandalised after an argument between two groups led to a clash in Alinagar police station area of Chandauli on Wednesday evening that left four persons injured. Advertising The groups, one with members from the Yadav community and the other Dalit community, filed cross FIRs, based on which two persons were arrested. One person received serious injuries while three suffered minor injuries. Chandauli SP Santosh Kumar Singh said the situation was under control. The incident took place on Wednesday at around 7pm when members of the Dalit community were taking out a procession in Nai Basti locality for Saraswati idol immersion. The bike of Ram Ashish Yadav, belonging to the Yadav community, brushed against Shivam who was walking with the procession. Dalit community members, part of the procession, slapped Ashish who left the spot and returned with a group of his community members. A war of words erupted between the groups that soon turned violent, said Singh, adding that though the clash was between people from two different castes, there was no caste angle to the incident. Atul Narayan Singh, station house officer SHO of the Alinagar police station, said, Dalit community members in their FIR said that they were attacked with sticks by Yadav community members. Chhote Lal Yadav who reportedly came to intervene suffered serious head injuries. The bike of Chhote s brother, Bhagwan Das, was set ablaze. A school bus stationed nearby was vandalised during the clash that went on for around 10 minutes before police reached there. An FIR was registered against five from the Yadav side under sections 147 rioting , 323 voluntarily causing hurt and 504 intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace of the Indian Penal Code IPC along with relevant sections of the SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

      "nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday said it intends to pass the order soon on whether to refer the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid land dispute case for mediation and asked all the parties concerned for the names of possible mediators for reaching an amicable settlement. A five judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and comprising Justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and SA Nazeer reserved the order on whether or not to refer the Ayodhya land dispute for mediation. Hindu bodies except Nirmohi Akhara opposed the suggestion of the court to refer the matter for mediation, while Muslim bodies supported the suggestion. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP Government, said the SC should refer it for mediation only when there exists an element of settlement. Senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, appearing for Ram Lalla Virajman, told the Bench that mediation has not yielded any result in the past despite repeated attempts. There is no dispute that Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya but the dispute is what is the Ram Janmasthan place of birth , he said, adding that he issue of Janmasthan cannot be mediated. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy told the SC, PV Narsimha Rao Government had in 1994 made commitment to apex court that if ever found that there was a temple, land will be given for temple construction. It is not only about property. It is about mind, heart and healing, if possible, the Bench said.\n",

      "The mastermind of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel is believed to have been killed in an encounter in the Tral area of South Kashmir, officials said Monday. The encounter in Pinglish area of Tral in south Kashmir's Pulwama district lasted past midnight in which Jaish e Mohammed JeM terrorist Mudasir Ahmed Khan alias 'Mohd Bhai' was among the three militants killed, the officials said. The bodies of the three militants are charred beyond recognition and efforts are on to establish their identity, they said. The security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Pinglish after receiving specific intelligence input about the presence of militants in the area. The operation turned into an encounter after the militants opened fire at the search party of the forces who retaliated. Lesser known JeM terrorist Khan has been identified as the brains behind the audacious terror strike in Pulwama that left 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel dead on February 14, officials said on Sunday. Piecing together evidence gathered so far, security officials said that 23 year old Khan, an electrician with a graduate degree and a resident of Pulwama, arranged the vehicle and explosives used in the terror strike. A resident of Mir Mohalla of Tral, Khan joined the JeM sometime in 2017 as an overground worker and was later drawn into the terror outfit by Noor Mohammed Tantrey, alias 'Noor Trali', who is believed to have helped the terror group's revival in the Kashmir Valley. After Tantray was killed in December 2017, Khan disappeared from his home on January 14, 2018 and has been active since then. Suicide attacker Adil Ahmed Dar, who blew his explosive laden vehicle next to a bus in a CRPF convoy on February 14, had been in constant contact with Khan, officials said. After completing his graduation, Khan did a one year diploma course as electrician from an Industrial Training Institute ITI . The eldest son of a labourer, Khan is also believed to be involved in the terror strike at the army camp in Sunjawan in February 2018, in which six personnel and a civilian were killed. His role has also come under lens in the Lethpora attack on a CRPF camp in January 2018 that left five CRPF personnel dead. The National Investigation Agency NIA , which is probing the February 14 terror attack, had carried out searches at the residence of Khan on February 27. A Maruti Eeco minivan was used in the Pulwama terror attack and it was bought by another JeM operative just 10 days before the suicide attack. The JeM operative, identified as Sajjad Bhat, a resident of Bijbehara in south Kashmir, has since been on the run and is believed to have become an active militant now, they said.\n"

At least 50 Fulani civilians have been killed Saturday in the village of Ogossagou by traditional hunters, a security source told AFP. They were killed with guns, machetes, he added. Cheick Harouna Sankare, mayor of neighbouring Ouenkoro, confirmed the toll. There are for the moment about fifty dead in the village. It is a massacre of Fulani civilians by traditional Dogon hunters . The toll was in danger of rising because they had no news of other civilians and the army was not yet on site to help them, he added. A Malian military source also reported the attack. The attack happened at Bankass, near the border with Burkina Faso, where there has been frequent inter communal violence. Two witnesses questioned separately by AFP said traditional hunters had burned down nearly all the huts in the village.

      "As Pakistan and India discuss the alignment of the Kartarpur Corridor, some 600 villagers who are facing forcible eviction due to the project say they will block the development work if denied compensation of their land on commercial rates. The entire population 600 of village Kothay Khurd, where Gurdwara Dera Sahib Kartarpur is located some 125 km from Lahore , has been ordered by the district administration to vacate their houses immediately for the development of the Kartarpur Corridor to facilitate the Sikh pilgrims from India. My ancestors had settled in the village even before the partition and now our fifth generation is living here. Some officials came here and told the residents that the government was planning to build Kartarpur Corridor on our land, therefore we will have to vacate the land, Mohammad Arshad of Kothay Khurd told reporters. We are living in the area for centuries and it was not possible for us to leave the area and the graves of our ancestors, another villager Zaeem Hussain said, adding that the government officials had only told them that they would be compensated after their land and houses had been acquired. Hussain said there has been consensus among the villagers to sacrifice their agricultural land but none of them is ready to leave their ancestral houses.\n",

      "Even as elections are round the corner, a series of crimes like dacoity, snatching and firing have rocked the State capital throwing up a major challenge to the Commissionerate police. On Saturday, two miscreants opened fire at a security guard of a marriage mandap on Tankapani Road under the Badagada police station. While the reason behind the attack is yet to be ascertained, it is being suspected that the assailants had come looking for the owner of the marriage mandap. The guard Gyanendra Mallick, who received bullet injuries on his left shoulder, was initially admitted to the Capital Hospital and later shifted to a private hospital as his condition deteriorated. Sources said the two miscreants called Mallick, who was on duty at the Kalyan Mandap and asked him about the whereabouts of the owner. After knowing from Mallick that the owner was not present at the mandap, they asked him water. When Mallick went near them, they opened fire at him. Police rushed to the spot after getting information and started investigation into the incident. In another incident, two unidentified miscreants attacked two youths with stones and lathis while they were sleeping on a footpath near Master Canteen late on Friday night. The injured youths were admitted to the Capital Hospital. On the wee hours of Friday, a former Army officer was looted and attacked with sharp weapons by some armed miscreants when he was on morning walk with his wife near Raghunathpur on the Patia Nandankanan Road. Similarly, five bike borne assailants looted gold ornaments from a woman at gunpoint and attacked her husband and a neighbour with sharp weapons at Sailashree Vihar on Friday early morning.

      "Even as the seat sharing talks between the CPI M and the Congress reached a dead end with the latter deciding to go it alone in the general elections a desperate Left Front on Tuesday extended its deadline by another 24 hours for the tri colour outfit to reconsider its stance. Till that time we will not announce candidates for the 4 seats that the Congress had won in 2014. The Left had at the outset of alliance talks said the two sides should not contest on seats they won in 2014. The CPI M had won Raiganj and Murshidabad seats while the Congress had bagged, Behrampore, North and South Malda and Jangipur. This time round the Congress had been demanding 17 18 seats while the Left was not willing to leave them more than 11 13 seats. Against this backdrop the Congress on Tuesday announced the candidates list for 11 seats. The Left had already announced its list of 25 candidates last week. On Tuesday it announced a list of another 13 candidates leaving aside 4 seats currently held by the Congress. We still want that the two parties should come to an understanding so that the anti TMC and anti BJP votes can be consolidated in one place. For that we are not announcing our candidates for the four seats that they won last time. Now it is up to the Congress. If they fail to respond favourably then we will be forced to go ahead with our list unilaterally, Left Front chairman Biman Bose said on Tuesday. The Congress however reacted sharply saying the possibility of alliance had ended. We also know that there is a need to defeat the TMC and the BJP but we cannot ally with the Left at the cost of our party s dignity. They are trying to blackmail us which is not acceptable to us. So consider the alliance talks as good as over, PCC president Somen Mitra said. Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury told from Behrampore that the Left had done a big mistake by unilaterally declaring its first list of 25 candidates when the talk process was on. Now they are trying to apply some balm on that injury. I wonder this balm will work now. Meanwhile, the political experts said that the TMC and the BJP will benefit the most from a four cornered contest. Instead of wasting their votes the voters will either vote for the BJP or the TMC in that case. Currently the Left voters are so much annoyed with the TMC that they will finally vote for the BJP. But the Muslim supporters of the Left will vote for the TMC in which case both these parties will benefit from the Left Congress divide, said political analyst BN Majumdar.\n"

The private hospital in Dubai, where Khanna was treated, had stopped the billing cycle for a couple of days and extended the period of payment. I have never seen a private hospital being generous to the extent of stopping the billing cycle after those initial few days, Anubhav was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Khanna had developed breathlessness a day after he arrived here and was rushed to hospital. Doctors diagnosed it to be a severe lung infection and his limbs began getting discoloured. The growing infection affected Khanna's left hand which had to be amputated.\n",

      "A visiting team of an Anti Terrorist Squad ATS from Bihar acting in collaboration with its counterparts from Maharashtra on Thursday arrested a terror suspect wanted in connection with the Pulwama terror attack, in Pune. Identifying the terror suspect Shariya Anwar ul Haq Mandal 19 , said to be a resident of Gajna, Bajipur in Nadiya district of West Bengal, the Bihar ATS raided a hideout at Khalumbre village Chakan located on the vicinity of Pune and arrested Mandal. Mandal was masquerading as a labourer at Khalumbre village. The visiting Bihar ATS team produced Mandal before a local court and obtained his transit custody. Mandal was taken to Bihar. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Mandal has links with two Bangladeshi nationals, Khairul Mandal and Abu Sultan, both of whom the Bihar ATS had arrested earlier. Khairul and Sultan are allegedly the members of the banned Bangladesh groups Jamat ul Mujaheddin and Islamic State of Bangladesh. The name of Mandal, holed up in Pune, cropped up during the interrogation of the arrested duo by the Bihar ATS personnel. As many 44 CRPF personnel were killed in the Pulwama attack. The incident, which was one of the deadliest terror attacks witnessed in J K, saw a Jaish suicide bomber ram into a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district. Many people were critically injured in the attack.\n",

      "Three days after a woman was killed and another injured, allegedly in crossfire during an encounter between CRPF and Maoists in Godelguda village in Chhattisgarh s Sukma district on Saturday, local villagers have alleged that the women were victims of a fake encounter . Advertising Activist Soni Sori has said that if action is not taken against the errant personnel within eight days, she would sit on a hunger strike with family members of the deceased woman and other villagers. Police admit that the two women, Podiyam Sukka and Kalmi Dewe, were not Maoists, but maintain that they were caught in the crossfire. Sukka died of injuries at a CRPF field hospital in Dornapal, while Dewe has a bullet injury on her thigh. According to Sori, three women from the village had gone to collect firewood on Saturday when they saw a CRPF team. They turned back towards the village, but the team opened fire, she alleged.

      "The Income Tax Department Saturday dismissed as a forgery document and a set of loose papers , the 'Yeddyurappa diary' about alleged bribe payment to top BJP brass that has created a political furore. The Congress, citing a media report, had Friday demanded a Lokpal probe into the charge that the state BJP chief had paid Rs 1,800 crore as bribe to the party top brass, which Yeddyurappa had dismissed as atrocious and malicious. Our conclusion after studying it was that it is a forgery document. It is a set of loose papers, principal chief Income Tax Commissioner of Karnataka Goa Region BR Balakrishnan told reporters. He said There was an attempt to just make use of the diary to influence some other investigation, which we have not succumbed to. We have done our job in this case as well. The documents, which were photocopies, were seized from Karnataka water resource minister D K Shivakumar's residence during a raid carried out by the Income Tax department on August 2, 2017, he said. The papers were sent to the forensic science laboratory in Hyderabad, which returned it saying that they need the original papers, Balakrishnan added. He said that whatever came out in the magazine Caravan which broke the story was not part of the Income Tax department's seized material. Balakrishnan stated that in view of various Supreme Court decisions on admissible evidence, this particular diary has no evidentiary value. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had said at a press conference in New Delhi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should come forward and clarify on the matter. Yeddyurappa had said that all issues raised by Congress leaders are irrelevant and false. The issue is a closed chapter, he had said, adding that he was consulting legal experts on the issue and thinking about filing a defamation case. Meanwhile, the state BJP demanded that the Congress leaders apologise after Balakrishnan dubbed the alleged diary as loose sheets of papers and a forgery document. Congress leaders who levelled false allegations against BJP and its leaders stand exposed in public. If Congress leaders have left any sensibility in them and respect for public sentiments, they should immediately apologise, the party said. Regarding the outcome of raids at a Karnataka minister's residence, apparently referring to Shivakumar , Balakrishnan, without mentioning his name, said the process to confiscate the Benami property worth Rs 75 crore has been initiated.\n",

      "The students of Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya continued their stir led by Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad ABVP for the second consecutive day in the university premises on Thursday. The agitating students said that they would continue with the protest till the indifferent attitude of the university management towards the interests of the student s changes. They further said that the management staffers had threatened them with dire consequences when they had raised their voice against the management and started boycotting classes. The trigger of the stir is the decision of the Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya management to abolish the student welfare council executive committee. The Kanya Gurukul campus students have also come in support of the agitating students. As per the allegation, the council was scrapped after the representatives of the student council had misbehaved with the vice chancellor Vinod Kumar when they met him. Speaking to The Pioneer, the president of the students welfare council Rahul Sharma said, By warning the students of expulsion and scrapping the executive committee of council, the management has made it clear that it is out to stifle their voice. But we are not to be cowed down. We have received support from the girl students council. The management would have to finally bow down, he added. Lending full support to the continuing stir by the students, the president of Kanya Gurukul students council Rakhi Panwar said, Classes are not being held regularly in the university. We are really disturbed. The district coordinator ABVP, Aditya Gaur, said that the agitation was fully justified, given the pitiable condition of the university. A representative delegation of students would soon meet the district administration and the police officers on the dismal situation prevailing in the university. We would also tell them about the threat and harassment the students are receiving from the management. We would demand them to intervene in the interests of the students, he said.\n",

      "The Parjang Assembly constituency will go to polls in the third phase on April 23. The seat was created in 2014 by craving it out of the erstwhile Pallahara constituency and adding to it a few areas from the Kamakhyanagar seat. Parjang and Kamakhayanagar are neighbouring areas within Dhenkanal district while Pallahara is in Angul district. With Pallahara gone, veteran leader and sitting BJD MLA and Transport Minister Nrusingha Charan Sahu has had an unenviable position. While Congress is not having a credible leader so far in the area, with its nominees getting changed since 2000, BJP no doubt is a force to reckon with. BJP s organisation was made strong in the area when Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan contested his debut poll and won it in 2000. Then of course, Parjang was under the Pallahara Assembly seat. An interesting strategy of canvassing for votes for Pradhan and Sahu had been while before the delimitation, Sahu, a native of Parjang, had to face anti campaigning as an outsider in Pallahara, after the delimitation, Pradhan who belongs to Talcher, faced a similar situation in Parjang. However, since 2009, the BJP has been nominating an old guard, Bibhuti Pradhan, who has so far been contesting polls unsuccessfully. Both the BJP and the BJD have re nominated Bibhuti and Sahu, Respectively, from the seat this time, while Congress is yet to make its choice open. The BJD repeated Sahu who still has a lot of fan following, considering his experience and the long period he has been representing the area. Needless to say, he has his pocket votes. The BJD is facing charges of corruption and nepotism. Besides, Parjang as a backward area with tribal, SCs, STs and OBCs comprising a major chunk of voters, has not witnessed much of development all these years. Pradhan will get advantage of anti incumbency against Sahu and it all depends how he capitalises it.\n",

      "Vijayawada With the traditional earthen pots adapting to changing times by adding taps for ease of use, more and more people are now buying them. Another reason for people to people again preferring water cooled naturally in earthen pots is the long term health effects. Many believe that artificially cooled water does not quench thirst as well as water cooled by earthen pots. These pots are available in various sizes, shapes and now, the taps of a contrasting colour are fixed to them. Ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 400, these pots are sold at makeshift roadside shops, usually by the potters themselves. However, there are retails too, making a quick buck in the summer season when the demand peaks. In fact, it s not the households but philanthropists who buy these earthen pots in bulk and set up water kiosks Chalivendram on the roadside to supply free drinking water to passersby. The clay water pots are available in sizes of 5, 15, 20 and 50 litre storage capacity. Pot seller G. Rambabu said that earlier, members of the Kummari caste used to make pots but the younger generation is not inclined to continue with the profession. He said that its only the older potters who continue to make, bake and sell these pots. The red clay pots with tap attached are in demand and the large black ones are generally bought by philanthropists to store water in Chalivendrams, he said. T. Leelavathi, a housewife, said that the water cooled in these earthen pots tastes better in the summer compared to that refrigerated. Earlier, we did not get pots with taps. This is a welcome improvement, she said. Science teacher B. Satyanarayana said that earthen pots lower the temperature of the water, a quality unique to clay. He said that clay pots are porous as they have small holes visible at the microscopic level that help cool the water. Mr Satyanarayana said that there are chances of the presence of harmful chemicals like BPA Bisphenol A in the plastic containers that clings onto water molecules.\n",

      "A Punjabi song titled Laawaris Laashan Da Waaris Khalra Protector of unclaimed and unidentified bodies , highlighting the struggle of human rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra, who fought against alleged fake encounters of Sikh youths by Punjab Police during militancy, was released on YouTube Saturday. Khalra was allegedly abducted and killed by Punjab Police in September 1995. Four Punjab policemen were later sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder. Advertising His wife Paramjit Kaur Khalra is contesting Lok Sabha polls as Punjabi Ekta Party PEP candidate from the panthic constituency of Khadoor Sahib and is garnering support even from leaders of some opposition parties. So much so that some leaders within the Shiromani Akali Dal Taksali wanted their own candidate former army chief General JJ Singh s candidature to be withdrawn in support of Bibi Khalra. The song released on YouTube has been written, composed and produced by a group of young men, running a music company Bhau Record . In the four minute clip, they can also be seen making a vote appeal for Paramjit Kaur and also announcing that whatever revenue they will earn from the views on YouTube, will be donated for her poll campaign. The lyrics of the song, narrating Khalra s fight against Punjab police, go like, Jaswant Singh si naam jodhey da, jiney waqt sarkaar nu si paaya . Sach 1984 da soormey ne, oh dunia tak pahunchaaya Oh Laashan Da banke masiha The name of warrior was Jaswant Singh, he dared to fight against the system. He took truth of 1984 to the people. He became messiah of unclaimed bodies . Advertising Kann kholte soorme khalsa ne, jehra system hoya bola si .paiyyan bhaajda jadd sarkaaran nu, soorme nu maaran da ailaan sunaaya 6 September nu laashan de waaris nu, chuk ke laash banaya The warrior made the voices heard to the system that had gone deaf over the years. Government was rattled and decided to kill him. The messiah of bodies was himself picked and reduced to a body on September 6 , it says further. Speaking to The Sunday Express, lyricist Ramandip Singh, who hails from Zira in Ferozepur said that he along with his friends composed the song in four days to support Paramjit Khalra and tell youths about Jaswant Singh Khalra. Youth in Punjab do not even know who he was. Our main aim is to educate new voters about him and his sacrifice for Sikh community. Whatever revenue we will earn from views on YouTube, we will donate it for campaign of Paramjit Kaur. We have not made the song for our own profit. Meanwhile, Paramjit Kaur said that she was yet to see the song but appreciates the effort . My husband had procured records of cremation grounds and it showed that Punjab Police killed youths and cremated unidentified and unclaimed bodies. The youths were killed and used to be cremated by Punjab Police in secrecy. He was able to procure record of at least 2,097 such bodies from three cremation grounds from 1978 to 1995. There were at least 25,000 such disappearances of Sikh youths in Punjab. He was killed in 1995 after he revealed his findings and United Nations UN took note of it. If people are supporting me and doing something at their own level, I appreciate it but I am yet to see this song, she said.\n"

      "Thousands of police fanned out across central Paris and other French cities Saturday for the 19th consecutive week of yellow vest protests, with officials vowing to prevent a repeat of the rioting and looting that marred last week s rally in the capital. Several hundreds of demonstrators began marching shortly after midday from a square in the south of Paris towards the Sacre Coeur basilica at Montmartre in the north, with banners calling for President Emmanuel Macron to Get Lost Authorities banned demonstrations in a large area in the west of the city, including the Champs Elysees, the scene of last Saturday s rampage by hundreds of black clad agitators. Dozens of police vehicles, including armoured trucks and water cannons, encircled the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the iconic avenue, with officers searching people s bags and patrolling in front of boarded up storefronts. At the opposite end of the avenue access was completely blocked to the Place de la Concorde, near the presidential palace and the National Assembly, and two drones were flying over the capital to track any protesters movements.\n",

      "While the elections are round the corner, Maoist related violence was reported from Malkangiri and Sundargarh districts, giving a headache to the security forces. In the first incident, the Red rebels killed a relative of a road construction contractor at Kukurkunda village under the Mathili police station of Malkangiri district. The deceased Gupta Swain was working as supervisor at the construction site. Sources said that a group of Maoists belonging to Bastar division of Chhattisgarh reached the village and mercilessly thrashed Swain and later slit his throat. The rebels also attacked other labourers present at the spot. They also torched a JCB and a Hywa truck engaged in the road construction from Kukurkunda to Temrupali under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana PMGSY , reports said. The Maoists also left posters on the spot issuing warning against public construction works in the area. Police have began a probe into the incident. In another incident, a group of miscreants suspected to be members of Peoples Liberation Front of India PLFI , a Maoist frontal organisation torched a road roller engaged in construction work at Sanramloi village under Bisra tehsil of Sundargarh district. Bisra police reached the spot and recovered a letter which issued threat to the road contractor.

      "Jawaharlal Nehru University JNU Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar alleged on Monday that the varsity students forcibly entered his house and confined his wife inside for several hours. Police, however, said there was a call for a march by some students, but security personnel stopped them when they tried to gain entry. This evening few hundred students forcibly broke into my JNU residence and confined my wife inside home for several hours while I was away in a meeting. Is it the way to protest Terrorosing sic a lonely lady at home Kumar asked on Twitter. A student from a Left outfit rejected the allegation and said a group of students had gone to meet the vice chancellor, but they were allegedly manhandled by the security personnel. Seven students have been on a hunger strike since last week in protest against the online system of entrance exam that will be implemented from this academic session. According to sources, students from Left outfits went to the vice chancellor's residence to demand an audience with him since he had not been meeting them. When they went to meet him last week, he offered them sweets rather than addressing their concern. On Monday evening, the students allegedly barged inside Kumar's residence while he was away and surrounded his wife. Police were called in and the wives of other university professors rescued her, a professor said. Kumar's wife was rushed to a hospital as she was in a state of trauma. We had gone to his residence to meet the V C. We were manhandled by security personnel and many students have sustained injuries, including JNUSU president N Sai Balaji, a student said.\n",

      "BJD supremo and CM Naveen Patnaik s craze is still intact in the four Assembly segments of Jagatsinghpur district Jagatsinghpur, Balikuda Erasama, Tirtol and Paradip. Jagatsinghpur is a general constituency which comprises Jagatsinghpur Municipality and Jagatsinghpur and Naugaon blocks. Dalit leader, former Minister, BJD district president and Deputy Chairman, State Planning Board Bishnu Chanran Das has a strong influence in the district. The youth mass and the student community comprise 40 per cent of the electorate who strongly demand nomination of Amarendra Das for the Jagatsinghpur seat. He is a former student leader and young advocate, who has been associated in the student and youth politics of the district over the last one decade. Amarendra has been instrumental in electing student leaders from almost all colleges of the district during the college union elections. Sources said that Amarendra too enjoys the confidence and trust of district BJD president Das and he is loyal to the BJD by every inch. We are pretty sure that Amarendra Das is a strong candidate, said district BJD vice president Dipti Das. As regards Tirtol, it comprises Biridi, Raghunathpur and Tritol blocks. In 2009, Rabindranath Bhoi was elected from the seat while in 2014 Dr Rajashree Mallick was elected. But now the two BJD leaders have turned unpopular in the area with their alleged involvement in questionable acts. Besides, they have failed to popularise the pet schemes of the BJD Government in the constituency. Political observers of the district therefore feel that in the prevailing scenario, Das would fit the bill. Biridi block which was previously in the Jagatsinghpur constituency is now in Tirtol constituency. Das enjoys massive support of Biridi Block which is virtually an invincible fortress for him. In addition, Das has a support base in Raghunathpur and Tirtol areas too. Various organisations of Tirtol constituency including youths, students, farmers and women strongly demand that Das be fielded as BJD nominee this time from the Tirtol seat. Any machination to deprive Bishnu of a ticket for the Tirtol Assembly segment may spell doom for the BJD, cautioned Rajkishore Khatua, a BJD loyalist and former president of Jagatsinghpur Bar Association. As regards Balikuda Erasama, sitting BJD MLA Prasant Muduli s support base has taken a beating. It is learnt that Dr Damodar Rout who intends to fight from this seat on a BJP ticket is facing serious challenges from the BJP rank and file with one Raghunandan Das emerging a strong aspirant. Thus political observers feel that it will be in the advantage of BJD if it fields a new face and that too, a woman. Notably one Basanti Pradhan, former Chairman of Erasama Block and former Zilla Parishad Member, who has her strongholds in Erasama and Balikuda, is a BJD ticket hopeful in the segment. Paradip occupies a pivotal place not only for entire Odisha but also especially for Jagatsinghpur district. It was the former place of Dr Rout who has recently switched over to BJP. In that case the workers of Dr Rout are not going to support Debasis Samantray, who is an aspirant from the seat. The voters of the constituency are now are confused owing to possible contest between Dr Rout from BJP and his son Sambit on a BJD ticket. Again, veteran trade union leader of Paradip Santosh Kumar Pattnaik has joined the race for the BJD nomination. Pattnaik has been working relentlessly over the last two decades for strengthening pro BJD labour union activities. Moreover, Pattnaik has a wide fan base. He has organised programmes like Jeevan Bindu and has created a record by collecting highest units of blood in the State.\n",

      "A day after a 34 year old woman and her two daughters aged 5 and 2 years were charred to death after the car they were travelling in caught on fire, the family members and relatives have blamed her husband, who had survived miraculously in the incident, for their deaths. However, Jasmeet Singh, the Deputy Commissioner of Police DCP , East district said don't believe rumours as investigation is still underway. On Sunday, Upender 36 took out his wife Anjana Mishra, the deceased, for an outing for the first time in 13 years of their marriage. Their three daughters, Nikki 1 and Mahi 6 and Siddhi 4 were returning from the Kalkaji temple in their Datsun Go car when the CNG fitted vehicle caught fire, said the senior police official. While Upender, who was driving the car, managed to escape along with his daughter Siddhi, the other three members of the family remained trapped inside the burning vehicle and died, said the senior police official. Whereas, the relatives and the family members alleged that this is a murder not an incident. Upender never took his wife for an outing in the 13 years of their marriage. Suddenly he made a trip which is not digestible for us. He had started torturing her after their first daughter was born as he wanted to have a boy and not a girl, said Braj Kishore Dixit, a cousin of the deceased Anjana. We believe that it is not an accident. It was a planned murder and we urged police to investigate the matter, especially the car. We want justice for Anjana, said Dixit. Anjana and Upender, who hail from Etah, got married in 2005. Upender was working in a car showroom while Anjana was a homemaker. Shyam, another relative of Anjana, said Upender used to beat and torture her. Earlier, he had threatened her several times and often said he would burn her and also opened a gas cylinder. Another relative Alok said neither Upender nor his family members informed us about the incident. He did not find her attractive. He also used to abuse her. Many a times, he told us that he will kill her and we would not be able to do anything. He also had an extra martial affair, he said. Upender, however rubbished the allegation and said Why would I kill my wife and daughters I loved them a lot. It was an accident and the fire started from the dashboard. I tried to save them and I also got some burn injuries while trying to rescue them. My wife and daughters were burnt alive in the car and I could not save them. I took the car on lease from Ola for my brother. It was 2018 model of Datsun Go. We got the car on Friday and from Monday, it was scheduled to take its first ride. As it was my holiday, I took my family to Kalkaji temple for an outing, said Upender.\n",

      "Clashes broke out on Thursday April 11 between workers of Telugu Desam Party TDP and YSR Congress YSRC at various places in Andhra Pradesh even as technical glitches in Electronic Voting Machines hampered the poll process at numerous polling booths as voting got underway for 25 Lok Sabha and 175 Assembly seats. In Guntakal, former MLA and contesting candidate of Jana Sena Party, Madhusudan Gupta, smashed an EVM in a fit of rage alleging that party symbols were not properly printed on the ballot unit. Madhusudan Gupta also shouted at the polling personnel on duty. Gupta was immediately taken into police custody. A mandal parishad member of YSRC was seriously injured when TDP workers allegedly attacked him at a polling station in Eluru city. In Jammalamadugu in Kadapa district, tension prevailed in Ponnathota village as YSRC and TDP workers indulged in stone throwing. In Narsaraopet constituency in Guntur district, YSRC leaders alleged TDP men ransacked a polling station in Yelamanda village and damaged the furniture. Police personnel were also preventing YSRC sympathisers from entering into the polling booth, YSRC leaders alleged. Minor trouble was also reported at a few other constituencies in Guntur, Prakasam and Anantapuramu districts as well but neither the election authorities nor the police confirmed the reports. State Chief Electoral Officer Gopal Krishna Dwivedi, however, said polling was going on peacefully across the state. In a statement, the CEO asked people not to believe in rumours as the poll process was going on peacefully. Gopal Krishna Dwivedi said the technical defects in EVMs, reported from various places, have been rectified. Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his family members exercised their franchise at a polling station in Undavalli village in state capital region Amaravati. Chandrababu Naidu's son Nara Lokesh, incidentally, is the TDP candidate from Mangalagiri Assembly segment that covers Undavalli. Talking to reporters, the chief minister referred to technical glitches in EVMs and said he was demanding that ballot papers be re introduced. No developed country is using EVMs as they are prone to manipulation. We have hence been demanding that we revert to the ballot paper system, Naidu said. YSR Congress president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy cast his vote in his native Pulivendula in Kadapa district, from where he is seeking re election. I am very confident that people are looking for a change, Jagan, who is aspiring for the chief minister's post, remarked. Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan exercised his franchise in Vijayawada. State Chief Secretary LV Subrahmanyam also cast his vote in Vijayawada. State Chief Electoral Officer Gopal Krishna Dwivedi cast his vote in Tadepalli. Interestingly, the VVPAT machine did not function when Dwivedi voted. This is the first general election in the state after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and creation of Telangana in June 2014. There are a total of 3,93,45,717 registered voters, including 1,94,62,339 men, 1,98,79,421 women and 3,957 transgenders. Of the total, 10.15 lakh are first time voters in the 18 19 age group.

      "Although the Congress has declared the name of Jadumani Barik as its candidate for the Champua Assembly seat but the BJD and the BJP are yet to do it resulting in uncertainty among the aspirants. After the visit of Champua Independent MLA Santatan Mahakud to Naveen Niwas some days back, it was speculated in the political circle that either Sana himself or Meenakshi Mahanta as his prot g may be made BJD nominee for the minerals rich Champua seat but situation changed the next day when Naltu Mahanta , one of the close aids of Sana and hundreds of Sana followers led by Kusha Apat joined the BJD in protest against the decision of the Sana to lobby for Meenakshi. Sources close to supporters of Sana said the candidature of Sana in BJD is opposed by local Minister Badri Narayan Patra who is rather projecting Kusha Apat while former Champua MLA Jitu Patnaik is lobbying for Reena Barik, who is working president of BJD, Keonjhar unit. Out of total seven Assembly constituencies in the Keonjhar Parliamentary constituency, the BJP has declared the names of six constituencies except Champua. Although ShreeManta Kumar Tripathy and Murali Kumar Sharma are two strong contenders of BJP for the seat, but the possibility that Kusha might join BJP if he is denied ticket in the BJD is not ruled out.\n",

      "The life of a four year old girl would have been saved if the ambulance in which she was being moved could have reached a hospital here on time. The girl, a resident of Satya Nagar Housing Board Colony, was being rushed to the nearby Nilachal Hospital by her family members after she was rescued from a water tank on Monday. But she lost her life on the way after the ambulance got stuck in a traffic jam on Janpath. The ambulance was stranded near the Big Bazaar Malisahi road, following which the driver took another route via Hotel Swasti Grand to avoid the congestion. However, the situation turned even worse as vehicular movement on Janpath had come to standstill due to rallies staged at Lower PMG by several organisations. The girl s helpless family members pleaded with the crowd with folded hands to clear the blockade. But the girl died by the time the ambulance reached the hospital. Surprisingly, when asked, the Kharavel Nagar police said they did not receive any such report.\n",

      "Holi was celebrated with traditional zeal and zest in Bokaro and Dhanbad districts on Thursday. Except few incidents, no major incidents were reported from the twin districts. According to reports from different police stations of Dhanbad and Bokaro , two deaths were reported while over 25 people mostly youths were injured in separate road accidents while at least seven were injured in a clash across the twin cities. A youth Vinod Kumar 20 , died in an accident at Chilka Bridge under Kathara police station. He was on his way to Gomia from Kathara on his motorcycle. His bike collided head on with a Hyva and Vinod died on the spot, said an eyewitness. While in another incident under Jharia police station, one youth died after his bike collided with another motorbike. It is commonly observed that drunk driving, coupled with the use of intoxicants, is the main reason for the spurt in accidents on the day of Holi festival, said OC V Kumar of the local police station. At least 9 people were injured in two separate clashes under Katras police station on Thursday afternoon, police said. Initially, a verbal clash erupted between Vikash Agarwal and Sonu Pasi and Subodh Mahato, Ramesh Mahato, Suresh Mahato and Chandrika Dey which later took an ugly look and resulted into injuries to all of them, said OC of the local police station. With the immediate intervention of cops, situation got controlled and injured were rushed to the hospital, said an eyewitness. Reports reveal that over 25 people, including one woman ,were injured in separate incidents in both districts on Holi all accidents involved motorcyclists and most of the cases were drunk and were driving. Amidst tight security, the festival of colours was celebrated with great zeal. Festival boozer, tipplers and occasional drinkers enjoyed the festival a lot. The traditional drink bhang found losing its charm this Holi. More and more people found opting for liquor over the traditional drink. Liquor sale ranks top this Holi, sold in black in Bokaro and Chas. In a bid to set the mood to make a splash with colours, all brands sold for as high as 50 to 60 per cent from its print price here, said Gaghender a tippler resident of Chas . There is no control over the market, we are forced to pay a high price as its Holi, he added. We have tried to contact Excise Commissioner in this regard but he did not picked up his mobile and later switched off his mobile, said Sukhdeo Ghatak another buyer. The Excise department sources said that there was an impressive increase in liquor supply and sales during Holi. There was an approximate 40 per cent increase in liquor sale during this festival, as compared to daily sales, he added.\n",

      "Rishabh Pant's utterly destructive 78 powered Delhi Capitals to a 37 run win over Mumbai Indians on Sunday, giving further proof of why he should be on the World Cup bound plane to England. Pant got those runs in only 27 balls and while the relentless onslaught would do his confidence a world of good, Jasprit Bumrah's shoulder injury two months before the ICC showpiece left the Indian cricket fraternity on tenterhooks. The Delhi dazzler's seven towering sixes and as many fours at a Wankhede Stadium that was made to look like a tiny ground left the Mumbai Indians bowlers, including the world's best pacer Jasprit Bumrah, traumatised and gave rechristened Delhi Capitals the fresh beginning they longed for. Sent into bat, Delhi Capitals notched up an imposing 213 for six in the stipulated 20 overs, and buried under a pile of runs, there was not much of a riposte from the hosts, who were stopped at 176 in 19.2 overs after an injured Bumrah failed to show up with the willow. Such was the 21 year old Pant's assault that Delhi raked in 99 runs in the last six overs. Pant smashed the world's best fast bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, for a few sixes as well. Pant, playing his natural game, mercilessly punished the Mumbai bowlers after South African Colin Ingram 47 off 32 balls 7x4, 1x6 and Shikhar Dhawan 43 off 36 balls 4x4 1x6 pulled the visitors out of the rubble and laid the foundation of a big total with their 83 run stand for the third wicket. Earlier, the duo of Dhawan and Ingram rallied the Delhi innings after they lost two quick wickets Prithvi Shaw 7 and skipper Shreyas Iyer 16 inside the first four overs and also took the Mumbai attack to cleansers. Later, barring veteran Yuvraj Singh 53 off 35 balls 5x4 and 3x6 , who made his first appearance for Mumbai, no other batsman stood tall. Yuvraj did roll back the years, with his fluent hitting, but his knock went in vain. Kasigo Rabada 2 23 removed Yuvraj in the 19th over to seal the victory for his team. Chasing 214, Mumbai Indians were never in the fray. They lost skipper Rohit Sharma 14 and Suryakumar Yadav 2 early. Quinton De Kock 27 hammered Trent Boult for two fours and a six in the third over and then found momentum in the sixth over as he hit two consecutive fours off Ishant Sharma. But Ishant 2 34 took revenge as De Kock holed to fine leg where Boult took a good catch as Mumbai slumped to 45 3. But then West Indian Kieron Pollard 21 and Yuvraj tried to resurrect the innings with their 50 run stand. As the two were looking good, Keemo Paul removed Pollard. Hardik Pandya o followed suit as Mumbai lost half the side on 95. After Krunal Pandya 32 off 15 balls departed, Mumbai's hopes were solely pinned on Yuvraj and he could not take the side home.\n",

      "The pilots union of crisis hit Jet Airways has approached the government flagging concerns about salary arrears, saying that the situation is leading to extreme tension and frustration, according to a letter. The cash strapped full service airline has been making delayed salary payment for the last few months and has also defaulted on loan repayments. Against this backdrop, the National Aviator s Guild NAG a grouping of over 1,000 pilots of Jet Airways has written to Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar. In the letter, dated March 6, the grouping has raised concerns about persistent delay in salary payment of member pilots. This situation is leading to extreme tension and frustration amongst our members, hardly an ideal situation for pilots in the cockpit... All pleas to the management in this regard have fallen on deaf ears, the letter said. A Jet Airways spokesperson said it has not received any such communication. The response came to a query regarding the pilots union approaching the Labour Ministry regarding salary arrears. The company remains committed to meet its salary obligations towards its employees and clearing all pending dues, the spokesperson said. Jet Airways has been looking at various ways to raise funds amid acute liquidity crunch that has forced it to ground aircraft, cancel flights in large numbers, shutdown stations and delay salary payments to its pilots and engineers along with other senior staff.\n"

      "Upset over an accusation of theft at the workplace, a 22 year old man was arrested after he killed his friend Gurfan Khan by slitting his throat in Mumbai's Vikhroli. Police said that the murder took place after the 22 year old was accused by his friend of theft at the workplace, the Mumbai Mirror reported. Police have booked the accused under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code for murder and arms act for carrying knife. The victim managed to call his employer and tell him that he was attacked by the accused Salman before he fell unconscious, which helped the police nab the accused within hours. The police said that the incident took place on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday on Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road JVLR . Following the attack, the victim was running down a road holding his bleeding throat and asking for help. A Metro official came to his help and informed the police. I work with Metro and was going to the site when suddenly someone came from behind. He was profusely bleeding. He was murmuring 'please save me', 'someone has attacked me'. He asked me to inform the police, so I called up 100 and narrated the incident. Meanwhile, I saw him calling someone from his mobile and within a minute after talking over the phone, he fell unconscious,'' said BP Singh, the Metro official told police, as quoted by the Mumbai Mirror. He was giving someone information about the attack and the location of the spot, Singh added. A police officer told media, Gurfan had called his employer, a woman. She told us that he had informed her that one Raja alias Salman had attacked him. Based on this information, we registered an FIR and started the probe. We managed to trace the accused to Dharavi where he was hiding at his relative's place. According to reports, Salman and Gurfan used to work together in a garment shop in Mumbai's Goregaon, where a theft had taken place, following which Gurfan suspected Salman and allegedly held him responsible for the same. Reports also said that the two has been fighting over the matter since a few days, as Salman feared that he would be replaced by Gurfan. On Monday night, after the work, Salman had taken Gurfan to JVLR and he suddenly slashed his neck with a sharp object. We have arrested him and are probing if any other accused is involved in the crime, said another police officer told media.

      "A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court Monday seeking direction to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and DGCA to ensure refund or alternative mode of travel to passengers who had booked tickets with Jet Airways, which has temporarily suspended all its domestic and international flights. The plea said the sudden suspension of air services of Jet Airways has resulted in a major crisis for the passengers who were not informed about it earlier. The application filed by activist Bejon Kumar Misra sought direction to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA to adopt prompt redressal mechanism for all affected passengers to access full refund of air tickets with reasonable compensation or arrange alternative mode of travel for them to reach their destination as an emergency exercise. The plea is likely to come up for hearing on April 24. The plea, filed through advocates Shashank Deo Sudhi and Shashi Bhushan, said, It is common knowledge that all competitor airlines have exorbitantly increased their airfares and the toothless and vulnerable consumers are constrained to suffer not only in terms of money, but also in terms of mental harassment of unprecedented scale. Citing media report, it said more than Rs 360 crore of the passengers consumers hard earned money is under threat due to non refund of ticket value. The passengers have to not only purchase alternative tickets at highly exorbitant cost, but also go through lots of anxieties and mental agony. This has resulted in profiteering by other airlines at the cost of the passengers and till date no relief has been announced by the respondents Ministry and DGCA . It is on record that such a situation was existing for more than two years, but was intentionally allowed by the authorities without any concern for passengers and other affected parties, the plea claimed. It also said an amendment to the existing laws and appointment of an effective regulator is the need of the hour to protect the interest of passengers and regulate airfares in an open and transparent manner to avoid such events in future. After months of uncertainty, Jet Airways announced temporary suspension of its operations on April 17 as it failed to receive emergency funds from lenders. A day after the airline suspended operations, hundreds of employees gathered in the national capital seeking measures to revive the carrier, which has been in operation for nearly 26 years. Domestic lenders have invited bids for selling stake in Jet Airways. On April 18, the lenders said they were reasonably hopeful that the bidding process for the airline would end successfully.\n",

Earlier this month, without naming Jaya Prada, Azam Khan while addressing an election rally in Rampur had stated, ...You got represented by her Jaya Prada for 10 years. People of Rampur, people of Uttar Pradesh and people of India, it took you 17 years to understand her reality. But I could recognise it in 17 days that she wears a khaki underwear.\n"

      "Terror attacks in India s hinterland decreased in a major way according to Ministry of Home Affairs MHA data, as revealed by Minister of State Hansraj Ahir in a written statement in Parliament on Tuesday. In the last five years, the hinterland saw just six terror incidents Three in 2014, one each in 2015, 2016 and 2018, and none in 2017. These incidents cumulatively claimed 11 civilian and security personnel, while seven terrorists were also killed. However, the situation in Kashmir deteriorated. There were 1,708 attacks in five years in the Valley, killing 138 civilians and 339 security personnels, while 838 terrorists were also eliminated. There is a close and effective coordination between intelligence and security agencies. A multi agency centre MAC has been strengthened and reorganised to enable it to function 24 7 for collection and sharing of information, Ahir said. He specifically mentioned Left wing extremism LWE attacks having gone down over five years, going down from 1,091 in 2014 to 833 in 2018.

      "Two members of a family died and two others sustained injuries after Peoples Liberation Front of India PLFI rebels barged into their house in a Gumla village and opened fire hours after Holi festivities concluded on Thursday. One of the survivors said that the family was resting at the courtyard of their house in Turundu village on Thursday evening after Holi festivities were over. Armed men, sporting uniforms, barged into the house and opened fire. Ramvilas Gope and Laxman Lohra died on the spot, while Gope s widow, Lilavati Devi and her son Tulsi Kumar had to be rushed to the hospital. The survivors are out of danger, sources said. Devi told the police that there was no rivalry between her family and the PLFI rebels. The police, however, suspect that refusal in payment of levy might be a probable reason for the attack. The village comes under the jurisdiction of Kamdara Police Station. Gumla Superintendent of Police, Anjani Kumar Jha, said that the bodies have been sent for autopsy and the police have launched a manhunt to nab the perpetrators. Further investigation will reveal the purpose behind the killings, he said. According to figures with the Ministry of Home Affairs, at least 18 of 24 districts in Jharkhand are LWE affected. Apart from the main CPI Maoist , there are at least 17 splinter outfits active in the tribal hinterland. A majority of the splinter outfits, police say, are involved in extorting money from businessmen, trafficking children and killing for sport. They have unleashed a reign of terror on innocent villagers here. PLFI, one of these splinter outfits, was formed by Dinesh Gope, an ex army man, in 2003.\n",

      "Uttar Pradesh Scheduled Caste Commission Chairman Brij Lal released documents to refute charges levelled against him and his family members by daughter in law Anita. Lal, the former DGP who is now a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party, has been accused by Anita of demanding dowry from her family members and forcibly getting her to sign blank paper to procure her kidney for her father in law. Subsequently, an FIR was registered at the Mahila police station in Lucknow. In a communiqu released on Saturday, Lal clarified that the charges made against his family members were baseless as his renal transplant took place in February 2017 while his son was married a year later, in February, 2018. The UP Scheduled Caste Commission chief said that his daughter donated her kidney as donors have to be a blood relative of the patient and hence there was no question of him asking or forcing his daughter in law to donate her kidney. Lal also claimed that his daughter in law stayed with his son for a few days after marriage and started living with her parents. Due to her behaviour, the two families had decided on getting through divorce proceedings. He said that he was shocked to find that his daughter in law fabricated baseless charges and lodged a case to defame him and his family members.\n"

      "Muslim clerics and political leaders have voiced their dismay over the clash of poll schedule with the holy month of Ramzan. However, a section of clerics has dismissed the objections as politics, saying that Jang e Badr was fought on the 17th day of Ramzan. Imam of Aishbagh Eidgah in Lucknow, Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali, urged the Election Commission to respect the sentiments of the Muslims and shift the poll dates of May 6, 12 and 19, as Ramzan was expected to start on May 6. He said that if the moon was sighted on May 5, the month of Ramzan would begin from May 6. Polling dates of May 6, 12 and 19 will hence fall during the fasting period and will subject Muslims to extraordinary hardships, the Maulana Farangi Mahali commented. The Maulana, who is also a member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board AIMPLB , suggested that the Election Commission either prepone the polling on these three dates or postpone them to a date after Eid after the culmination of Ramzan. We will make a formal representation to the Election Commission in this regard, both in writing and digital form, Maulana Khalid Rashid said in Lucknow on Monday. At a news conference in New Delhi on on Sunday, the Election Commission had announced the schedule of the seven phase general elections, to be held from April 11 to May 19 with counting of votes on May 23. Meanwhile, AIMPLB secretary Zafaryab Jilani said that he did not remember any Lok Sabha election being held during Ramzan, though Assembly elections have been held during the holy month of fasting. The Election Commission may or may not have considered Ramzan while deciding the dates. There are Supreme Court judgements that once the election process starts, the court cannot interfere in the process, said Jilani, who is also convenor of Babri Masjid Action Committee. All India Muslim Women s Personal Law Board president Shaista Amber also voiced her reservation over the poll schedule. She said that never in the democratic history of India were general elections held during Ramzan. Jamait Ul Hind Arshad Madni group general secretary, Maulana Abdul Aleem Farooqui, said the Indian Meteorological department had made forecast that this summer would be warmest due to climate change. If the Election Commission could adjust election dates, it would help Muslim voters to exercise their franchise in Ramzan, he said. If the Election Commission looks at its decision and adjusts the dates so that they don t clash with Ramzan, it will be better, he said. The Election Commission usually takes into account all factors while finalising the dates of elections so that people do not face inconvenience. But it is quite possible that while deciding the poll dates, the ECI might have overlooked Ramzan.\n",

      "Madhya Pradesh Police, CRPF clash over Income Tax raids Reacting to a clash between CRPF and MP Police over IT raids at MP CM Kamal Nath's OSD's residence, former MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said what Mamata Banerjee did in West Bengal, same is happening in Madhya Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh Police, CRPF clash over Income Tax raids The Income Tax Department sleuths conducted raids on more than 52 locations across the country and recovered undisclosed cash to the tune of Rs 10 to 15 crores approx on Sunday. Sleuths of the Income Tax Department raided the offices and residences of the close aides of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath after receiving a specific tip off about the presence of huge cash and jewellery at their residences. The officials conducted raids over charges of tax evasion, hawala transactions and in search of black money. The reports suggest a strong possibility of this cash being used to bribe voters in the upcoming elections. After a series of raids at several places, IT officials shared a preliminary report of raids with the Central Board of Direct Taxes CBDT and the Election Commission. The raids were conducted at offices and residences of MP CM Kamal Nath s former Officer on Special Duty OSD Pravin Kakkad, former adviser Rajendra Miglani and executives linked to his brother in law s firm Moser Bayer and his nephew Ratul Puri s company in Indore, Bhopal, Goa and Delhi. Reports added that Ashwin Sharma who is allegedly associated MP CM s OSD Pravin Kakkad were also covered during the raid. CRPF vs MP Police Earlier the day, following the raids, the Central Reserve Police Force CRPF personnel and Madhya Pradesh Police officials were engaged in an argument outside Ashwin Sharma s the residence. Talking to the media, CRPF official Pradeep Kumar levelled allegations against the MP Police and said that state police interrupted in their work and abused them. He added that CRPF personnel were only following seniors orders and performing their duty. Proceedings were on, that s why they did not allow anyone to come in. Reacting to the recent development in Madhya Pradesh, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the IT department is doing its work, it s their constitutional right. The CRPF forces performing their duty when they were stopped and the Madhya Pradesh Police clashed with them. Referring to an incident, which took place several months ago, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had staged a sit in as a mark of protest against the apathy of the Centre towards the state, What Mamata Banner did in Bengal, Kamal Nath is going to do the same thing in Madhya Pradesh.

      "The families of two men, who were picked up in a case of robbery and murder and allegedly tortured to death in custody in Sitamarhi on March 7, have decided to approach the State Human Rights Commission and the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court once the postmortem report is out. Advertising Police teams are still conducting raids to arrest the five suspended policemen of Dumra police station, who escaped from custody at Runisaidpur police station. The policemen are yet to be named in the FIR. Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey said, All five policemen could face dismissal if they do not surrender soon. A departmental proceeding has already been initiated. They will be duly named in the case in due course of investigation. Gufran Alam 30 and Taslim Ansari 32 , residents of Ramdiha village under Chakiya police station of East Champaran, were picked up on March 6 from their homes. Advertising Photos and a video clip of their bodies being washed before their burial showed marks of nails hammered into them. Their families have shared these with the police, an FIR has been registered for murder, and five policemen, including Dumra police SHO Chandra Bhushan Singh, have been suspended. Gufran s uncle Sanawar Ali said, It is strange that Sitamarhi police have not been able to arrest five policemen, who are not yet named in the FIR for murder. Ali said they were waiting for the postmortem report which was also being delayed . When the state DGP has clearly blamed the policemen and asked them to surrender, only the postmortem report findings are needed to support us legally, said Ali, adding that former JD U Rajya Sabha MP Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi has promised them to move the state human rights panel. Gufran s father Munavvar Ali said since they were not satisfied with the probe, they would also approach either the Sitamarhi or Motihari Chief Judicial Magistrate Court to file a murder case against the five policemen. Taslim s father Molajim Ansari said, Gufran s family is coordinating with us to file a joint application before the state human rights panel.\n",

      "Mumbai An executive engineer of Mumbai's civic body was arrested Tuesday in connection with the last month's foot overbridge FOB collapse outside the iconic CSMT station here in which six people were killed, police said. This is the second arrest of a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation BMC engineer in two days and third since March 14 when the deck of the 40 year old bridge connecting the area near the Times of India building with the CSMT station, collapsed during evening rush hours. On Monday, police arrested assistant engineer S F Kakulte, working with the bridges department of the BMC. Last month, police arrested structural auditor Neerajkumar Desai. The accused Anil Patil was arrested by Azad Maidan police this evening. He worked with the bridges department of the civic body between September 2014 and December 2018, said DCP, Zone I, Abhishek Trimukhe. Patil has been booked under section 304A Causing death by negligence of the Indian Penal Code IPC . The DCP said both the engineers were aware that such incidents like bridge collapse might happen, but acted negligently. During our investigation it came to light that they had knowledge of their job and due to their negligence the incident took place, the DCP said. Patil will be produced before court Wednesday, he said, adding that a court remanded Kakulte in police custody till Arpil 5. Kakulte was booked under IPC section 304A causing death by negligence . A preliminary report into the collapse submitted by the BMC had said the structural audit of the foot overbridge at CSMT railway station in south Mumbai was not carried out properly. It suggested major lapses when the structural audit of the FOB was carried out on August 13, 2018. Desai, who worked with a private firm, had allegedly gave clearance for continued use of the ill fated bridge after a structural audit, police had said.\n",

      "Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan traded barbs amid reports that the state police and Central Reserve Police Force personnel entered into an argument during Income Tax raids in the state. Nath alleged that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was misusing state bodies against opponents. It will be appropriate to comment only when the situation regarding the I T raids is clear but the entire country knows as to how and against whom they have been using constitutional bodies for the past five years, he said in a statement issued on Sunday evening, according to the Hindustan Times. They use these bodies to frighten others . When they have nothing to say on development, they use such sinister design against opponents. Nath said the BJP has resorted to such action to draw advantage in the election as it was facing an imminent defeat. Nath claimed the ruling party had adopted similar tactics during the Assembly elections last year. We were also prepared for the same, he said. There should be impartial inquiry into everything. This is not going to affect us. The Income Tax Department on Sunday conducted raids at the Indore home of Praveen Kakkad, an officer on special duty to Nath. Reports said that central forces and the state police entered into an argument outside the house of Ashwin Sharma, who is Kakkad s associate. A Central Reserve Police Force official said the state police were not letting them work, while police claimed they were trying to help people in the residential complex. Madhya Pradesh s Director General of Police, VK Singh, said there were no signs of police interfering with the Income Tax raids. But there have been reactions which could have led to a law and order issue and law and order issue can be handled only by the state police because only it s empowered to do so, he said, according to Hindustan Times.

      "Bhopal Indore New Delhi, April 7 In a major crackdown on hawala money, Income Tax Department teams on Sunday carried out raids at over 50 places in Madhya Pradesh's Indore and Bhopal, including the residence of Chief Minister Kamal Nath's Officer on special duty Praveen Kakkar, and in New Delhi and seized a huge amount of cash. A senior IT department source told IANS About 300 IT Department personnel from New Delhi were given the task after receiving a credible information about the hawala money. The IT officials raided Kakkar's office on the sixth floor of Platinum Plaza building and his residence in Nadir Colony in Bhopal. Kakkar's house and office in Indore were also searched, sources said. Kakkar, an ex police officer and the President's Medal recipient, had also served as OSD to former Union Minister Kanti Lal Bhuria. Similarly, the residence of NGO manager Ashwini Sharma on Platinum Plaza's fourth floor was also searched. The official also identified luxury cars reportedly belonging to Sharma. It was for the first time that the IT teams were accompanied by Central Reserve Police Force troopers. The source said that the searches are linked to suspected movement of hawala money during the ongoing polls season and tax evasion. Sources said that besides Kakkar and Sharma, premises of Kamal Nath's former adviser Rajendra Miglani and executives linked to his brother in law's firm Moser Bayer and his nephew Ratul Puri's company were also searched. The sources said that the documents seized during the searches were being scrutinised in detail and then it will summon officials later for questioning. Official sources also said that searches were also being conducted against Kolkata based businessman Paras Mal Lodha.

The source said that the IT Department also got tips from Puri's questioning and thus planned a series of raids in the state.\n",

      "The motorcycle allegedly used as getaway vehicle by the killers of former BJP MLA Jayanti Bhanushali was found abandoned by a head constable in Kutch, but he did not put it on police records and handed it over to the accused, not knowing it would be used in the crime , the police have said. The constable, Jenti Maheshwari, was suspended late Thursday on charges of dereliction of duty . The police said there is no evidence linking him directly to the murder conspiracy, so he has not been arrested. Advertising The alleged shooters, Shashikant Kambley and Ashraf Sheikh, both residents of Pune, were arrested from Gujarat s Dang district earlier this month. Bhanushali, 56, a former BJP MLA, was shot dead on board Sayajinagari Express train while it was between Gandhidham and Samakhiyali in Kutch district on January 8. He was headed for Ahmedabad from Bhuj. Chhabil Patel, a fellow BJP leader, was arrested from Ahmedabad airport on March 14, soon after his return from the US. Director General, CID Crime, Ashish Bhatia, had said that during interrogation Patel admitted that he got Bhanushali killed over an ongoing rivalry. Advertising Kutch West Superintendent of Police Saurabh Tolumbia had directed Bhuj Deputy SP J N Panchal to conduct an inquiry against head constable Maheshwari after receiving instructions from the office of the state DGP. Tolumbia told The Indian Express on Friday The inquiry revealed that the constable did not make any entry into police records after recovering the unclaimed bike from Gadhshisha area around a year ago. He also made personal use of the bike, which is serious dereliction of duty. He then handed over the vehicle to people accused in this case. We have suspended him with immediate effect. Bhatia said the suspended policeman had pleaded ignorance about the murder conspiracy. There is not enough evidence to arrest him. The criminal liability lies with people who used the bike in committing the murder as well as those who arranged for the bike, he said. Earlier, an SIT probe had concluded that Chhabil Patel had allegedly hired the two shooters to kill Bhanushali over political rivalry. The investigators said Patel allegedly got suspended constable Maheshwari to give the unclaimed bike to the alleged shooters to be used as getaway vehicle after shooting Bhanushali.\n",

      "INDORE Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath s officer on special duty OSD Praveen Kakkar on Tuesday broke his silence over the two day long raids conducted by Income Tax officials at his residence and offices, calling it a political operation. Despite the two day long raid, they Income Tax Department didn t find any document that they could seize, they didn t recover any cash or jewellery. They didn t find anything objectionable, it was a political operation, he told ANI. The I T department officials from New Delhi raided the residences of Kakkar in Indore and former advisor to Kamal Nath R K Miglani in Delhi in the wee hours of Sunday. The raids against Kakkar and Miglani were conducted on charges of alleged tax evasion. I T department officials raided several locations in Indore, Bhopal, Goa, and NCR. On Monday, the I T officials questioned Kakkar's son Salil and continued to raid various locations across the country. The I T officials also raided the residence of Ashwin Sharma, a close aide of Praveen Kakkar. Sources told ANI that Ashwin was responsible for getting most of Praveen s companies registered in Salil's name. Meanwhile, a heated argument broke out between CRPF and Madhya Pradesh Police officials on Sunday when I T officials went to raid Ashwin Sharma's home. Sharma is a businessman by profession. Commenting on the heated argument between CRPF and MP police, former Chief Minister and senior BJP Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that Mamata Banerjee did in West Bengal, the same is happening in Madhya Pradesh under Kamal Nath's watch. I am surprised that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh instead of cooperating, he is trying to stop the Income Tax Department s proceedings. What Mamata ji did in West Bengal, the same game is being played in MP, Chouhan said at a press conference. Launching a direct attack on Kamal Nath, Chouhan accused the chief minister of trying to save the corrupt by stopping the proceedings of I T Department.\n",

      "New Delhi Delhi Police have arrested Apoorva Tiwari, the wife of ND Tiwari s son Rohit Shekhar for murdering her husband. The police have cited a turbulent and unhappy marriage as the motive. A Delhi court has remanded Apoorva in two day police custody. Rohit Shekhar, the son of the late veteran politician ND Tiwari, was smothered to death on the intervening night of April 15 and 16, an autopsy report said. Additional Commissioner Crime Rajeev Ranjan said that Apoorva smothered her husband and choked him with a pillow after the couple got into a fight April 16. Apoorva had a heated argument with her husband over Rohit drinking alcohol with a woman relative. On the night of the incident, the couple had a fight over a relative. Rohit had been drinking all the way from Uttarakhand to Delhi and was not in a condition to resist. During the fight she pounced on him and smothered him, he told reporters. She reportedly entered Rohit s room April 16 and executed the crime. She later allegedly destroyed the evidence. All this happened within one and half hours, said the officer. Apoorva Tiwari has confessed to the crime. She has confessed. As of now, from the fact and circumstances, it seems the killing was not planned. The background was there that they had a turbulent marriage and Rohit Shekhar and his family were planning to part ways. After interrogation, it was found that Apoorva Shukla Tiwari and Rohit had a turbulent marriage. All her hopes with the marriage were belied, Ranjan said. Apoorva, a practising lawyer with the Supreme Court, was being questioned in connection with the killing since last Sunday. Discrepancies were found in her statements which led police to suspect her involvement, the officer added. Police has also claimed that a property dispute was behind the murder. Property was also one motive since Apoorva was not getting any portion of the property, said Ranjan. Rohit s mother Ujjwala alleged Sunday that Apoorva and her family were money minded and wanted to acquire the family property. A servant found Rohit was bleeding from the nose April 16. According to the postmortem report, the death occurred within two hours of his last meal around 11 pm.\n",

After interrogating over 40 suspects, including overground workers who had links with Maulana Masood Azhar's organisation and electronic surveillance, security forces were able to neutralise four terrorists and four others who were aware of the plot. Among those eliminated were Kamran, the district commander of Pulwama, who was killed near Pinglena village in Pulwama. Mudashir Ahmed Khan eliminated by the security forces, who provided logistical help in Tral. He had provided the explosives for the attack and was in touch with Aadil Ahmed Dar, the suicide bomber. Also killed that day was Sajid Bhat from Anantnag. The Maruti car used in the attack was registered in his name. Two others, including Nisar Ahmed Tantry are in custody. Tantry, from Aripal, Tral, was aware of the plot and had fled to the UAE weeks for the attack. UAE sent him back. Both Mudashir and Nisar were in touch with Yasir, a Pakistani explosives expert, who may have prepared the car bomb used in Pulwama. Sajjad, another JeM member, was arrested in Delhi. He was in touch with Mudashir and two overground workers. Sajjad told security forces about Mudashir's role in the planning and execution of the attack. Muhammed Umar, JeM's chief operations commander in Jammu and Kashmir, was killed in an operation on March 29 in Sutsu Kalan, near Srinagar. Umar's father was Ibrahim Azhar, Masood Azhar's brother and the leader of the group that hijacked the flight IC 814 on Christmas eve in 1999. Umar had attacked the Police Lines in Pulwama in August 2017. The JeM is responsible for a number of major attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. They include the attack on the Army camp in Samba in September 2013, the attack on the Pathankot air base in January 16, the Uri attack in September 2016 and the one on the Sunjuwan base in Jammu in February last year.\n",

      "After coming to know of Annu and Preeti's relationship, Dinesh planned to kill them, police said. Image for representation A Delhi policeman allegedly shot dead a couple at a temple here, apparently because the woman had ended her relationship with him, police said on Saturday. Dinesh Kumar, assistant sub inspector with the Delhi Traffic Police, and his accomplice Pintoo were arrested, days after the bodies of Preeti, 32, and her fianc Annu Chauhan, 26, were found in a temple in 'Sai Upwan' near the Hindan river, police said. An FIR was lodged by the girl's father Pramod Kumar, DIG Upendra Agarwal said. Dinesh reportedly told police that he was in a relationship with the woman, Preeti, for the past 12 years. When he proposed marriage to her, she declined, and instead told him of her wish to get engaged to Annu Chauhan, who owned a glass shop in Ghaziabad. On March 25, Dinesh shot Annu and Preeti with his service revolver as they were coming out of a temple. The duo died on the spot. Police said Dinesh was all the more angry with Preeti because she had changed her phone number a week before the murder and had severed all contact with him. The accused has told us during questioning that he killed the woman and her friend because she had been ignoring him for some time and had even changed her phone number so that the traffic inspector could not contact her. What angered him all the more was that the woman was going to get engaged to another man, said Upender Kumar, the Ghaziabad SSP. After coming to know of Annu and Preeti's relationship, Dinesh planned to kill them, police said. On March 25, Dinesh and his friend Pintoo followed the couple's scootie when they were on their way to the Sai temple in 'Sai Upvan', officials said. When the couple came out of the temple, Dinesh had a heated argument with them and in a fit of anger shot them. Police have recovered a 9 mm service pistol, three live cartridges and the car which was used in committing the crime. Annu, who lived in Sarvodaya Nagar, and Preeti, who was from Pratap Vihar, had been in a relationship for the past three years and were going to get engaged in a few days when they were shot dead. Annu, originally from Uttarakhand, had been running a glass shop in Ghaziabad for the past few years, while Preeti worked at a private school in Indirapuram. According to sources, Dinesh had joined Delhi Police as a constable in 1994 and was promoted as head constable in 2008. He again got a promotion in 2016 and became a sub inspector. Currently, he is posted in Seemapuri area of North East Delhi as a traffic inspector.\n"

      "This is the second arrest of a BMC engineer in two days since the 40 year old bridge collapsed. On Monday, police arrested assistant engineer S F Kakulte, working with the bridges department of the BMC. Photo ANI Mumbai An executive engineer of Mumbai's civic body was arrested Tuesday in connection with the last month's foot overbridge FOB collapse outside the iconic CSMT station here in which six people were killed, police said. This is the second arrest of a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation BMC engineer in two days and third since March 14 when the deck of the 40 year old bridge connecting the area near the Times of India building with the CSMT station, collapsed during evening rush hours. On Monday, police arrested assistant engineer S F Kakulte, working with the bridges department of the BMC. Last month, police arrested structural auditor Neerajkumar Desai. The accused Anil Patil was arrested by Azad Maidan police this evening. He worked with the bridges department of the civic body between September 2014 and December 2018, said DCP, Zone I, Abhishek Trimukhe. Patil has been booked under section 304A Causing death by negligence of the Indian Penal Code IPC . The DCP said both the engineers were aware that such incidents like bridge collapse might happen, but acted negligently. During our investigation it came to light that they had knowledge of their job and due to their negligence the incident took place, the DCP said. Patil will be produced before court Wednesday, he said, adding that a court remanded Kakulte in police custody till Arpil 5. Kakulte was booked under IPC section 304A causing death by negligence . A preliminary report into the collapse submitted by the BMC had said the structural audit of the foot overbridge at CSMT railway station in south Mumbai was not carried out properly. It suggested major lapses when the structural audit of the FOB was carried out on August 13, 2018. Desai, who worked with a private firm, had allegedly gave clearance for continued use of the ill fated bridge after a structural audit, police had said.\n",

According to a senior IT department official, the cash was shifted from Kingston College belonging to Duraimurugan Educational Trust, Vellore to the cement warehouse of the DMK leader, considered close to party treasurer Duraimurugan, late on March 29. The official said the cash was shifted due to the botched up operation by the state police and revenue authorities and was found on Monday morning in the cement warehouse by the IT investigation wing. All the cash was stuffed in cartons and gunny bags neatly packed for distribution to division and ward wise, the official said. Meanwhile, Duraimurugan and his son D.M.

    "text = r'The ruling Trinamool Congress and the opposition BJP, who are ready to battle it out in the Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal, are preferring turncoats over their tried and tested leaders. There is discontent over candidate selection within both the parties dominating the poll scenario in the state. Senior TMC leader and its South Dinajpur district chief Biplab Mitra said there is anger among grass roots level workers of the party over giving tickets to newcomers and ignoring the old timers. The TMC is going solo and has declared names of candidates for all 42 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP declared its first list of 28 contestants in the state on Thursday. The two parties defend their decision, saying winnability was of prime consideration for them. However, the TMC feels it is the best way to quell the infighting in the party, whereas for the BJP, fielding turncoats had become a compulsion as it did not have enough candidates to assure its victory. We have party leaders and workers who are working very hard. We had given them tickets in panchayat and assembly polls. But in case of fighting Lok Sabha polls, we don t have enough candidates who can put up a fight and win, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said last Friday. Out of 18 new faces in TMC s list, seven are those who have either switched over from the Congress or the Left parties in the past few years. Two of the TMC s sitting MPs in north and south Bengal Dasarth Tirkey and Sunil Mondal who have been renominated this time, used to be MLAs of Left Front constituents RSP and Forward Bloc, respectively. BJP s list has six candidates who were earlier either with the TMC or the CPI M . It also includes the name of an ex IPS officer, who was once considered close to TMC chief Mamata Banerjee. A TMC leader told PTI on condition of anonymity that infighting is one of the biggest problems being faced by the party this time. There are so many factions in every district that it was next to impossible to bring all the disgruntled leaders on the same page...That is why in at least seven seats which are considered tough, we have pitted those who have come from other parties so that opposing factions will at least unite under their umbrellas to help us win, he said. Out of the seven candidates who have either switched over from the Congress or the Left parties in the past few years, three have been nominated from Bolpur, Medinipur and Coochbehar which the TMC had won last time. In Malda North, Raiganj, Jangipur and Murshidabad seats, which were won by the Congress and the CPI M last time, the TMC has nominated MLAs and MPs who had switched over from the Congress in the last two years. In Cooch Behar, former Left Front minister Paresh Chandra Adhikary was nominated as only a strong candidate can ensure in retaining the seat in the face of factionalism and resurgent BJP there, said a senior TMC MLA from north Bengal. The reason is the same behind nominating former state Congress president Manas Bhunia from Mednipur and Asit Mal from Bolpur. Former Congress MP Mausam Benazir Noor, who crossed over to the TMC, and has been nominated from Malda North seat told PTI, I had joined TMC as I feel only it can fight against communal BJP in the state. On the other hand, sitting TMC MP from Bolpur, Anupam Hazra has switched over to the BJP and has been fielded from Jadavpur seat in the city. In Murshidabad, TMC youth leader and key organisational man Shamik Hossain was overlooked in favour of former Congress MLA Abu Taher, who had switched over only last year. The situation is more difficult in the BJP, which had won two seats in 2014 and now targeting to win 23 seats in the state. The BJP has emerged as the main opposition party after the 2018 panchayat polls. The party in its first list has five candidates who had recently defected to it from the TMC and one from the CPI M . Former IPS officer Bharati Ghosh who recently joined BJP will be contesting Ghatal Lok Sabha seat on the party s ticket. During her stint as the Jhargram SP, she was considered to be the defacto TMC district president. Former TMC MLA Arjun Singh, who recently switched over to the BJP, has been pitted against TMC s Dinesh Trivedi in Barrackpore.Singh had quit the TMC recently after the party denied him a ticket for the Barrackpore seat. Former TMC MP Soumitra Khan has been given BJP ticket from his Bishnupur seat, while former CPI M MLA Khagen Murmu will contest on a BJP ticket from Malda North. Former TMC leader Sreerupa Mitra Chowdhury, who had contested polls on that party s ticket from New Delhi, is the BJP candidate from Malda South seat this time, while TMC youth leader Nishith Pramanik, who was expelled last year, has been fielded from Cooch Behar. The BJP has fielded another TMC turncoat Bolpur MP Anupam Hazra from Jadavpur. BJP leader Mukul Roy, once TMC s number two, defended the saffron party s decision on fielding turncoats. Anybody who wants to fight against TMC misrule in Bengal is welcome, Roy said. BJP workers had staged protest in Cooch Behar and Malda North against the party s decision to nominate TMC and CPI M leaders instead of local party leaders. Several BJP leaders, including its vice president Raj Kamal Pathak, have submitted their resignation and protests have been organised in various parts of the state over candidate selection. The seven phase polling in the state will begin on April 11.'\n",
