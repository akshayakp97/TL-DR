This has put Verma in the dock, who \u2013 according to another ex-Home Ministry official \u2013 tortured him to implicate IB officers.\nThe most-damaging comments came from former deputy secretary RVS Mani, who said the \u201cCBI team probing the Ishrat case tortured him to implicate IB officers in the controversy.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone question IB inputs and reports from Maharashtra and Gujarat governments till 2009? Facts are facts. What suddenly changed that the Centre was forced to file two affidavits contradicting reports of its own agency?\u201d wondered Arun Kumar Jain, ex-joint secretary in the Home Ministry. Jain never received any input suggesting that Ishrat, Amjad Ali, Pillai alias Javed Sheikh and Zeeshan Johar were not terrorists.\nAfter Mani\u2019s disclosure, another officer, K M Mehri from the Ahmedabad FSL, narrated Verma\u2019s high handedness, saying he had a hidden agenda. Mehri said Verma had threatened his senior with dire consequences. \u201cWe were telling the truth, but it appears he wanted something else,\u201d Mehri said.\nEarlier, Verma had told a TV channel that all the charges Mani had levelled against him were baseless and he never tortured him. Verma, who is accused of an alleged fake encounter in Porbandar, had concluded that Ishrat and three others were killed in a fake encounter and the IB was involved in the incident.\nThe Special Investigation Team, which probed the alleged fake encounter, maintained it was tasked to probe whether the encounter was staged. This argument seems weak as a senior Home Ministry official noted that the change in affidavit was made before the SIT was constituted and it was part of larger conspiracy to \u201cfix\u201d Narendra Modi.\n\u201cThe previous government changed the affidavit, discrediting Intelligence Bureau (IB), so that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) could be allowed to take up the case. The second affidavit favoured a central probe in the encounter. This is what UPA wanted,\u201d the official said.\nMuch evidence, including phone intercepts of terrorists, was overlooked to ensure that the focus of the investigation continued to be political.\nThe official said that Sheikh and Ishrat assumed false identities whenever they checked into a hotel. \u201cWhy would anyone come up with false identity unless there is something to hide or someone on a mission with ulterior motive,\u201d he said.\nIshrat and Sheikh were in Lucknow in May 2004, a month before the encounter. The record in Mezbaan International Hotel shows that Sheikh introduced himself as Abdul Rehman and Ishrat as his wife Ayesha.\nAnother LeT terrorist, Amjad Ali, was introduced as Rajkumar.\nSheikh had also rented accommodation in Pune in the name of Sayeed Abdul Wahid. They stayed in Hotel Radhika as a couple where he gave his name as Ahmad Yusuf in the hotel register. On May 26, both had checked in Hotel Ajanta as Rajesh Kumar and Geeta.", "url": "http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/mar/06/Was-Tortured-By-CBI-Team-to-Implicate-IB-Officers-in-Controversy-Claims-Mani-900341.html", "label": 2}
