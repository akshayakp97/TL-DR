Intelligence Bureau (IB) had shared specific information about the presence of militant near Army camp in Uri. Despite specific information regarding possible militant attack, Indian Army failed to stop it. Did Indian Army ignore the intelligence inputs about Uri terror attack? Defense experts have also warned the Army about the possible infiltration of militant in Kashmir because of the 73-day long unrest.\nAccording to media reports, specific information about possible terror strike at the Uri installation was shared with army official of the Uri brigade. \u201cWe had reports of militant presence in the area and same was shared with army,\u201d an officer was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times. Moreover the IB, while sharing specific information about attack on Uri camp, warned the army of a infiltration bid too. An increase in the infiltration bid across the Line Of Control was reported in last two months because of the unrest in the valley. The spike in infiltration bids also increased the presence of militant in Kashmir.\nIt was reported by Gen Syed Ata Hasnain, former Corp commander of Srinagar-based Chinar Corp that he had also warned the Army against the attack. He said preventing the attack was not possible but some measures could have been taken in order to avoid such a deadly attack that claimed lives of 18 jawans.

Warned the Cdr specifically on 8 Sep. Happened in 10 days. Done to remove pressure from hinterland Army move,\u201d. \u201cPreventing suicide attack is difficult, damage control is always possible. Main danger is of suicide bombing not witnessed since 2004\u2019\u2019, he mentioned in another tweet.\nThe HQ is 6km from LoC. Trts have struck parliament, also Twin Towers.
