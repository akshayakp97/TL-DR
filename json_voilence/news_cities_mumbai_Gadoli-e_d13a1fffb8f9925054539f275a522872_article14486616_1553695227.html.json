All the five policemen were suspended by the Haryana police subsequently. On Wednesday last week, the SIT arrested Sub-Inspector Pradhuman Yadav, head of the team that shot Gadoli.\nAccording to police sources, constables Jitendra Yadav and Vikram Singh, surrendered before the SIT on Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cWe had teams in Haryana constantly visiting the residences of both the constables as well as other possible places where they could be hiding.
