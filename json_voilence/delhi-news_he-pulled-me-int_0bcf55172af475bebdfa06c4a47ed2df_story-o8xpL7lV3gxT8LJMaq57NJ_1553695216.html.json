A woman who was part of the group complained that she was threatened with rape and alleged that when they approached Haryana police officials they refused to file an FIR.\nA zero FIR has now been filed on the basis of her complaint at the Vasant Kunj police station, under the appropriate sections. JNUSU president Mohit Pandey said the woman is in deep trauma after the incident. \u201cToday we are going to meet Commissioner of Police in Faridabad. The girl is in deep trauma. Police is very carelessly saying that they will ask Surajkund Police station to take statements,\u201d Pandey said on Friday.\nIn their complaint, the students have said that the incident took place when they were on their way back on August 15 after an evening at the lake. The woman hitched a ride with two of her friends on a bike till the main road, when they were allegedly intercepted by an elderly man with lathi, who called for others to join him.\n\u201cFour people tried to grab us. The guy who stopped us was drunk and asked we were doing there. The other guy slapped me and abused me,\u201d says the FIR.\nThe woman has alleged that she was groped and questioned about her relationship with the boys in the group. She was then allegedly dragged to a temporary shed by a man.\n\u201cThe other people assaulting us supported the move of the guy and advised him to forcefully push me inside the shed to rape me,\u201d the woman has said in her complaint.\nThough the students managed to escape and approached the Surajkund police station, the cops allegedly refused to file their complaint.\n\u201cMy character was questioned by the police officials,\u201d the student has stated in the FIR. She said that they were allowed to leave only after they wrote an apology letter that had been dictated to them by the policemen.\nHaryana Police has now begun probe into allegation that cops at Surajkund police station did not register case on the complaint of the students. \u201cWe are investigating who was on duty at the police station and why an FIR was not registered,\u201d said Surajkund SHO Pankaj Kumar.\n\u201cI have just come to know about the incident. We are investigating it,\u201d ACP NIT Shakir Hussain said, confirming that the students had visited Surajkund police station.\nFirst Published: Aug 18, 2017 10:50 IST", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/he-pulled-me-into-shed-to-rape-me-jnu-girl-after-attack-on-students-near-delhi/story-o8xpL7lV3gxT8LJMaq57NJ.html", "label": 2}
