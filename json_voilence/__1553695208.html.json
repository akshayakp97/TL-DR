We have already presented an algorithm and are working on designing the identification algorithm to match composites with digital face images,\u201d Singh said, adding that the team was also working on expanding the dataset.\nShe said, in the present stage i.E. Without a matching algorithm in existence, the entire process requires more efforts by forensic experts.\n\u201cFor instance, if a Delhi native is murdered in Bengaluru, then the Karnataka Police will have a skull or its composite model, but figuring out the nativity of the skull will consume a lot of time,\u201d Singh said as she emphasised that automating the process was imperative.\n\u201cThere are very few experts in this area in India and the world. Reconstruction of a skull requires a week\u2019s time if done manually. The workload is quite heavy. Even if there is an automatic tool to make the composite, the process does not end there,\u201d she noted.\nThe project has been taken up in collaboration with the West Virginia University. PhD students Shruti Nagpal and Maneet Singh of the university, alumnus Arushi Jain, Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi Mayank Vatsa, and Professor and Associate Chair at CSEE Department, West Virginia University Afzel Noore are also associated with the initiative.
