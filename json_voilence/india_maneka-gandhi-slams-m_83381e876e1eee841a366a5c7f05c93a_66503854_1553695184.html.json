Despite requests from his own forest department and people all over India, Sudhir Mungantiwar , minister for environment and forests, Maharashtra, gave orders for the killing,\u201d said Maneka Gandhi , women and child development minister, in a statement on Sunday, adding that she will write to CM Devendra Fadnavis seeking strong action. The CM did not respond to the comments.Continuing her personal attack on another BJP minister, she said: \u201cThis is the third tiger being killed on directions of the environment and forests minister. Earlier, a dozen leopards and 300 wild boars were killed on his directions. I am shocked that such a person is continuing to hold a ministerial position.\u201dLater in the evening, Mungantiwar issued a statement, rebutting Gandhi\u2019s claims. \u201cAlthough she is an animal lover, as a women and child development minister she (Gandhi) should also think of those women who died in tigress attack,\u201d he added.Mungantiwar said instead of taking up the issue legally or complaining to the CM, the Union minister has the right to set up a five-judge high-level committee to investigate the matter. \u201cManeka Gandhi criticised the lack of information. Neither minister nor secretary has a right to decide to kill animal; the decision was taken as per the guidelines of the NTCA.\u201dThe minister taunted Gandhi, saying the government had ordered the tigress to be caught after five people were killed. The number of deaths jumped to 13 after animal lovers got a stay from the high court.Earlier, the Maharashtra minister had defended the Avni operation. \u201cAvni was shot dead as a last resort when all attempts to tranquillise her failed and she attacked officials,\u201d he was quoted by PTI as saying. The minister said nobody in the forest department wanted to kill the tigress and hundreds of personnel were trying to capture her alive for the last three months. In September, the Supreme Court had said Avni could be shot at sight, which prompted a flurry of online petitions seeking pardon for the tigress.In other tweets, Gandhi said: \u201cEvery time, he (Mungantiwar) has used the Hyderabad shooter Shafat Ali Khan and this time, his son has also appeared on the scene illegally to kill the tigress. His son was not authorised to kill. This is patently illegal.\u201d She added that Shafat Ali Khan is a \u201ccriminal known for supplying guns to anti-nationals and for a suspected case of murder in Hyderabad\u201d.Mungantiwar claimed Khan was hired by the Bihar government 15 days ago. And Gandhi being a Union minister, she could have a warrant issued against Khan for criminal charges and put him behind bar. To take action against him is not the duty of his forest department.\u201cThe tigress was a mother. Now her two cubs will also die. We cannot allow this kind of insensitive and merciless attitude towards animals to prevail,\u201d said Gandhi. Mungantiwar was quoted by PTI as saying that the cubs are now nearly 11 months old and capable of surviving in the wild. \u201cYet, the forest department will ensure their upkeep,\u201d he said.(With inputs by Sujit Mahamulkar)", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maneka-gandhi-slams-maharashtra-government-for-t1s-murder/articleshow/66503854.cms", "label": 2}
