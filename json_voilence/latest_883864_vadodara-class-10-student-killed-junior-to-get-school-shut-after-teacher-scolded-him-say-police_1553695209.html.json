He allegedly stabbed the Class 9 student on Friday morning to force the school to close after a teacher had scolded him \u2013 similar to an incident in Gurugram last year, the police said.\nThe 17-year-old student was arrested in Valsad town under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. The police said that he did not know the victim and had no animosity towards him. The Class 9 student who was killed was admitted to the school just over a week ago.\n\u201cThe accused had displayed behavioural problems on several occasions in the past, for which he was scolded by his teachers,\u201d Vadodara Police Commissioner Manoj Shashidhar told the Hindustan Times. \u201cThe accused wanted to take revenge against the school and wanted it to shut down. He found the victim when he reached the school on Friday. The victim could have been any student.\u201d\nThe accused had allegedly collected all the sharp weapons by himself from various places for the crime, investigators said. After the boy\u2019s body was found with stab injuries, investigating officials had made the Class 10 student a suspect based on closed-circuit television footage. They had found a sharp-edged weapon and a chilli powder mixture in the student\u2019s bag.\nIn September 2017, a seven-year-old boy was found murdered in the toilet of a private school in Gurugram, Haryana. A 16-year-old student was detained for the murder. The Central Bureau of Investigation said the Class 11 student took the step to get the school closed so that a parent-teacher meeting and an examination would be deferred.", "url": "https://scroll.in/latest/883864/vadodara-class-10-student-killed-junior-to-get-school-shut-after-teacher-scolded-him-say-police", "label": 2}
