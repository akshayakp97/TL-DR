The Supreme Court recently stayed the trial court proceedings in the case.\nAdvertising\nThe apex court had on March 20 issued notices to the Haryana government and the CBI on a plea by the father of 15-year-old Junaid, who was allegedly lynched by a mob on board a train in June last year. The plea had sought a probe by the central agency into the incident, termed by the family as a \u201chate crime\u201d because of allegations that the accused mocked the victim\u2019s skull cap. The court had also stayed trial proceedings in the case pending before a Faridabad court. The father, Jalalludin, had challenged the Punjab and Haryana High Court order, which rejected his plea for a CBI probe.\nThe appeal contended that the investigation in the case was botched up. \u201cThe true nature of the crime has been subjected to cover up. The conduct of the named accused and others as a lynching mob has been concealed. It has been projected as if the occurrence/events were sudden, without any element of perpetrators having acted as in conspiracy or as an unlawful assembly,\u201d he contended, adding that police avoided charging sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief).\nIn June last year, Junaid, his brother and two cousins, were attacked on a Mathura-bound train by a mob, which also hurled communal slurs at them. The teenager was stabbed to death during the attack.\nAdvertising\nOn December 5, 2017, the murder trial was stayed by a division bench of the high court after Junaid\u2019s father filed an appeal against an earlier single bench judgment that had dismissed their plea for a CBI probe.\nSix accused \u2014 Naresh Kumar, Ramesh Kumar, Rameshwar Dass, Pardeep Kumar, Chander Parkash and Gaurav Sharma \u2014 are facing trial in the case. At least 15 prosecution witnesses have already been examined by the trial court.", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/junaid-khan-murder-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-rameshwar-das-bail-supreme-court-5114697/", "label": 2}
