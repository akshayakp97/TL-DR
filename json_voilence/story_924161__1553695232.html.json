Deaths in communal incidents also saw a spike to 43 from 26 last year while the number of those injured in such clashes increased to 961 from 701, the figures show.\nHome ministry officials blamed state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and West Bengal for not keeping such clashes from increasing. The figures nonetheless reflect poorly on the Centre too ahead of the Parliament session beginning on Tuesday.\nThe home ministry, last year, patted its back for a reduction of more than a fifth in incidents of communal violence compared to that in 2013 as the number dropped to 644 in 2014 from 823 in the previous year while the deaths fell to 95 from 133.\nThe number of those injured in communal clashes in 2014 also dropped to 1921 from 2,269, the ministry had said earlier.\nThe spike in figures in 2013 was however largely attributable to two major riots that led to many casualties \u2013 in Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh and Dhule in Maharashtra. Last year saw a major riot in Saharanpur in UP.\nThe ministry claims that there was no major communal riot in the country till May this year. However, serious communal clashes were reported from Atali village in Haryana.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 22nd, 2015.\nRead full story", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/924161/rising-clashes-india-witnesses-25-rise-in-communal-violence/", "label": 2}
