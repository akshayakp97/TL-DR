Both cases are being tried together before special CBI judge S J Sharma here.\nTo a question by the defence lawyer, Tamgade said he also had evidence to conclude that Sohrabuddin Shaikh and his partner Prajapati were \"used\" by Amit Shah, then Minister of State for Home in Gujarat, for firing at the office of an Ahmedabad-based builder.\nHe had interrogated Shah, marble trader from Rajasthan Vimal Patni, and Rajasthan minister Gulabchandra Kataria in the case, he said.\n\"There was some incriminating material against the trio. But those statements were not filed in the charge sheet,\" he said.\nThe defence then moved an application, saying the CBI should produce these statements in the court. The court will hear the application Thursday.\nShaikh, a suspected gangster with terror links, was shot dead on November 26, 2005 while he was in custody of Gujarat Police in an alleged fake encounter. His wife Kausar Bi was also allegedly killed later.\nPrajapati, an aide of Shaikh who was said to be a witness to the encounter, was allegedly killed by police forces of Gujarat and Rajasthan at Chapri in Gujarat's Banaskantha district in December 2006.\nOf the 38 persons charged by the CBI for the alleged fake encounters, 15 have been discharged.
