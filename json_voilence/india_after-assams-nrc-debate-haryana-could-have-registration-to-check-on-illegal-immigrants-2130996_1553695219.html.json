While she has already warned against NRC in West Bengal, there are some states in the north-eastern part of the country that have already begun checking on the influx of immigrants.\n(Also read: A traitor and an anarchist - how BJP hit back at Mamata)\nThe issue at hand is that names of 40.07 lakh applicants in Assam did not find a place in the final draft of NRC. While BJP has assured that they have a two-month window to appeal, the Supreme Court too has said that no coercive measures would be taken against those not on the list.
