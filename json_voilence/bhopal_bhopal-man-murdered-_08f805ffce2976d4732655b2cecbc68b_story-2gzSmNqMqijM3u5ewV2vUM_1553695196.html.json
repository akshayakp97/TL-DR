Their bodies were exhumed from a house in Raipur on Monday, following which Das was interrogated for nearly two hours.\nPolice said mathematics, a subject that the youth hated, was one of the main reasons behind his parents\u2019 murder.\n\u201cUdayan told us that his parents, particularly his mother, used to force him to study mathematics. He hated his parents because of this. Though he wanted to pursue a career in social sciences and the arts, his parents wouldn\u2019t let him,\u201d said Raipur additional superintendent of police Vijay Agarwal.\nThe police officer said Das claimed to have a deep interest in photography, painting, poetry, cartoons and writing. \u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t feel even a tinge of remorse about murdering his parents because they were \u2018Mr and Mrs Hitler\u2019. Murdering them helped pave the way for Udayan to pursue his other interests,\u201d Agarwal added.\nPolice said Das was a \u201cbrilliant\u201d student till Class 8, but started failing and went into \u201ca sort of depression\u201d after being forced to study mathematics. The accused speaks flawless English, and also dabbles in information technology and a number of art forms.\nPolice say Udayan Das speaks flawless English, and also dabbles in information technology and a number of art forms.

So he forged his parents\u2019 signatures to release their money from the bank,\u201d another police officer said, adding that the bank officials who allegedly helped Das forge the documents are also under the scanner.\nDas \u2013 an only child \u2013 used to live with his parents at Raipur. While his father was a foreman with BHEL, his mother worked as a data analyst at Vindhyachal in Bhopal. They had three houses at Raipur, Delhi and Bhopal \u2013 the combined rent of which came up to Rs 80,000 per month.\nDas\u2019s mother also received a monthly pension of Rs 30,000.\nSources said the accused became acquainted with his live-in partner \u2013 Akanksha Sharma \u2013 through Orkut (a defunct social networking site) in 2007. He managed to convince her that he was a software professional based in the United States.\nSharma, a native of Bankura in West Bengal, left her parents\u2019 house and met Das at Delhi in June 2016. The duo then reached Bhopal, where their relationship turned sour. Police said Sharma was murdered 20 days later, on December 27.\nFirst Published: Feb 09, 2017 16:28 IST", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bhopal-man-murdered-parents-for-forcing-him-to-study-maths-say-police/story-2gzSmNqMqijM3u5ewV2vUM.html", "label": 2}
