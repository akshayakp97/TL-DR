His body will be flown back to his ancestral village in Nagaland soon.\u201d\nHis illness prevented Isak Swu from attending the signing of a historic Naga Peace Accord on August 3, 2015 between the NSCN-IM and the Indian government at Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s residence.\nA colourful personality, Isak Swu was a co-founder of the NSCN \u2013 often dubbed the mother of all insurgent groups in the country \u2013 in 1980 along with long-time Naga comrades Thuingaleng Muivah and S.S. Khaplang. The NSCN was formed to protest the Shillong Accord signed between the Indian government and the Naga National Council (NNC).\nBut differences cropped up within the NSCN after some time, leading to the departure of Khaplang, who formed his own group, the NSCN-K. This group is still at war with India.\nMuivah and Isak Swu remained together, mostly resident in Thailand and the Netherlands, even after deciding to go for talks with New Delhi.\nAnd while Muivah was considered the group\u2019s dominant hardline leader, Isak Swu represented its softer side maintaining close ties with the Church.\nA former member of the NNC, Isak Swu was born in 1929 in Chishilimi Naga village in Zunheboto district of Nagaland.\nHe took early education at the American Mission School at Chishilimi and the Government High School at Kohima. He graduated in Political Science from St. Anthony\u2019s College in Shillong.\nHe joined the underground in the late 1950s. He was the foreign secretary of the NNC before being elevated as its vice president.\nMarried to Khulu, the couple have five sons and one daughter.\nIsak Swu\u2019s death comes at a time when the NSCN-IM and the Indian government are still negotiating for a final conclusion of the Naga Peace Accord.\nThe Naga insurgency is India\u2019s oldest and is known to have received at various times financial and other support from Pakistan, China and the US.\nFrom demanding independence from India, the NSCN-IM now seeks a \u2018Greater Nagalim\u2019 or Greater Nagaland comprising Nagaland as well as Naga populated areas of neighbouring states.
