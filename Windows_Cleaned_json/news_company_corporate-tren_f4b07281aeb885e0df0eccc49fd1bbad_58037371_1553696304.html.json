He doesn\u2019t have hands. He lost them in an accident when he was eight.Darshi Vasavada of IIM Indore\u2019s class of 2017 has only 50% vision, meaning she often needed a writer for her exams, and suffers from a rare genetic disorder called Kartagener\u2019s syndrome that caused her dextrocardia, a defect where the heart is on the right side of the chest. But that has not stopped her from bagging a pre-placement offer from Tata Steel to work in Jamshedpur.Aneja and Vasavada are among tens of differently abled 2017 graduates from Indian Institutes of Management ( IIMs ) who have been snapped up by companies including the Mahindra Group, L\u2019Oreal, Samsung , Accenture, Asian Paints, HCCB, PwC, ICICI Bank Amazon and TCS , campus insiders said.Companies are increasingly appointing persons with disabilities (PWDs), not just to meet their corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations but also to tap a loyal talent pool, sources said.These firms are encouraged by the government\u2019s inclusive initiatives such as the Accessible India campaign.\u201cAcross IIMs, courtesy initiatives such as Accessible India, there\u2019s been a new high in terms of differently abled candidates being recruited,\u201d said Prakash Singh, placements chairperson at IIM Lucknow.Campus insiders said just five IIMs \u2014 Bangalore, Indore, Calcutta, Lucknow and Tiruchirappalli \u2014 this season placed more than 50 PWD candidates with disorders ranging from visual and hearing to locomotive. They were offered salaries up to Rs 20 lakh.\u201cOur PWD students are no different from the rest of the batch in terms of what they can achieve. The fact that they have been able to leverage their abilities and make it to the PGP (post-graduate programme in management) despite the not-so-accessible environment in our country, itself speaks volumes of their capabilities,\u201d said Rajluxmi V Murthy, chairperson, office of disability services, at IIM Bangalore.Sapna Agarwal, head of placements at IIM Bangalore, said all 12 differently abled students in the batch have been placed. IIM Calcutta has placed nearly 14 differently abled students across various domains, with finance throwing up the maximum job opportunities for those with special needs.IIM Lucknow placed six differently abled students in Amazon, Dabur , L\u2019Oreal, Janalakshmi Financial Services, TCS and Value Prospects. The list included 21-year-old Paridhi Verma, who has only 10% vision. She will join Janalakshmi Financial Services.At IIM Indore, the figure is as high as 18. Organisations including Capgemini, Cognizant Business Consulting, L&T, Tata Power , Tata Steel and Tata Trust have hired multiple candidates in roles such as consulting, finance, general management, marketing and operations, said Bhavya Kapoor, placement officer at IIM Indore.Abhishek Totawar, placements chairperson at IIM Trichy, said three differently abled students got placed from the 2015-17 batch in HCL, Muthoot Housing Finance, and Dr Agarwal\u2019s Health Care.Educational institutions have 3% reservation for students with disabilities, though several are unable to fulfil the quota.Companies say differently abled candidates are often untapped pools of talent.\u201cOur experience of recruiting such talent has been very positive and a great learning experience,\u201d said Roshni Wadhwa, HR director at L\u2019Or\u00e9al India, which started hiring differently abled candidates last year. It has recruited two candidates this year: Aditya Bagda from IIM Lucknow and Sunny Joon from IIM Kozhikode. Both suffer from locomotor disability. \u201cAs part of our diversity and inclusion agenda, by 2018, our goal is to have 2% of our total employee strength in India to be constituted by employees with disabilities,\u201d Wadhwa said.Some organisations such as the Mahindra Group provide better physical infrastructure for their PWD employees and conduct sensitisation exercises among other employees.The group this year recruited visually challenged Aditya Singhvi from IIM Bangalore to work with Mahindra Holidays and Leisure. \u201cWe would definitely look at hiring more differently abled candidates provided we are able to match the right candidates to the right roles,\u201d said Prince Augustin, EVP-group human capital and leadership development at Mahindra & Mahindra.Those working for the betterment of PWDs welcome the change in India Inc\u2019s attitude towards the differently abled. \u201cIt is a fantastic thing that organisations are focusing on creating an inclusive culture,\u201d said BS Nagesh, founder of Trust for Retailers and Retail Associates of India (TRRAIN) that runs Pankh, an initiative to train PWDs to make them part of inclusive growth in retail sector.\u201cWe have seen the impact this has at the lowest level. At management levels, when students from institutes such as the IIMs go on to become managers, not only does the effect percolate down, they also become brand ambassadors of inclusiveness in the organisation,\u201d Nagesh said.Top differently abled students such as Vasavada and Aneja have already overcome several challenges in life that they are ready to lead by example.\u201cPeople like me, who face certain challenges, tend to be that much more focused and dedicated. I feel I need to prove something,\u201d said Vasavada, who once had to give up an opportunity to pursue her engineering at NIT in favour of another engineering college in her hometown in Gujarat. She is positive about her internship stint in Tata Steel\u2019s supply chain management function and said people were always there to guide her.Aneja, 24, took a gap after his schooling to live without the support of his parents and figure out if he could manage on his own. An SRCC (Shri Ram College of Commerce, New Delhi) graduate, Aneja started writing with his leg, and then his mouth when artificial limbs did not suit him. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t end, not with an accident, not with disability. You keep trying till you succeed,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/india-inc-opens-doors-wide-for-differently-abled-iim-graduates/articleshow/58037371.cms", "label": 1}
