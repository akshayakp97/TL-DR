Several people here have opposed the Bill, but it seems they (the Central government) are determined to pass it,\" Sharma told IANS.\nSharma, who is known for films like \u2018Leipaklei\u2019, Ishanou, was bestowed with the Padma Shri award in 2006. The filmmaker has also won several national film awards for his contribution to the film industry.\nThe Bill, which was passed in the Lok Sabha on January 8 has led to several protests across the northeastern states.\nEarlier on February 1, Assam Students\u2019 Union (AASU) held a candlelight protest in Assam against the Bill. Several organisations including Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) also staged a protest in the state against the Bill in January.\nLast month, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) snapped its ties with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assam over the Bill.", "url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/citizenship-bill-filmmaker-aribam-shyam-sharma-returns-padma-shri/359122", "label": 1}
