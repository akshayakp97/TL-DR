It had ruled if someone practices it, then an FIR should be filed against them under the Indian Penal Code\u2019s section 309 (punishment for attempting suicide) and police should undertake an investigation into it.\nAnyone provoking or supporting them should also be booked under section 306 (abetment of suicide), Soni told IANS.\nIn Jaipur, Jains took out a march while keeping their shops and businesses closed and not sending their children to schools and colleges. Schools owned or run by the community remained closed.\n\u201cWe want to educate people on Santhara so we took out this march,\u201d said Vijay Jain, a shopkeeper.\n\u201cThere is a need to understand that Santhara and suicide are not the same,\u201d he added.\nSimilar marches were observed in other parts of the state including Kota, Banswara and Ajmer among others.\nHundreds of Jains marched in Agra, Meerut, Baghpat, Lucknow, and Ghaziabad as well as Jain dominated areas of Firozabad and Tundla in Uttar Pradesh. While the protestors wore black bands, many people downed the shutters of their business establishments in solidarity.\nIn Mainpuri, the bastion of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, people belonging to the Jain community took out processions and gathered at the Mandi Ramdas to express their displeasure at the court ruling. They said Santhara cannot be equated to suicide and that it was a matter of faith, something which cannot be checked or challenged by any court.\n\u201cA person is driven to suicide by depression, frustration or anger while Santhara is the highest practice of giving up one\u2019s body on one\u2019s own volition,\u201d said Prasoon Jain, who runs a photography studio in Mainpuri.\nA demonstration was also held in Khekhda area of Baghpat in western UP and in Etmadpur and Chipitola areas in Agra, where protesters who included a fair number of women and children also gave a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate.\nIn Gorakhpur city of eastern Uttar Pradesh, a \u2018Dharm Bachao Andolan\u2019 (Save Religion Movement) march was taken out where protesters said they will not tolerate interference in their religious beliefs.\nJain community leaders said on an average every year, 300 people gave up their life by this practice of Santhara and the number was around 100 in Rajasthan alone.\nProtests and demonstrations were also reported in many parts of Madhya Pradesh including capital Bhopal, commercial capital Indore, Jabalpur, Morena, Gwalior and Ujjain.\n(IANS)", "url": "http://www.economylead.com/states/jain-community-protests-ban-on-religious-fast-to-death-87040", "label": 1}
