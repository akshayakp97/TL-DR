A slightly higher rate of 18.5 to Rs 23 per litre is offered by the Co-operative sector, say media reports.\nMaharashtra ranks 7 in milk production in India. Maharashtra which boasts of a strong cooperative movement in general is weak when it comes to dairy cooperatives. While Gujarat offers Gujarat Rs 29.5 per litre it is abysmally low in case of Maharashtra.\n\u201cTo spur domestic demand, milk distribution programme has also been started in Karnataka, Bihar and Rajasthan through anganwadis. In Rajasthan milk and dairy products are distributed through the mid-day meal scheme,\u201d it says.\nEarlier, milk powder import duty was increased from 30% to 40%. DGFT has been requested to increase export incentive for milk and milk products and Casein from 10% to 20%.\nIt bears recall that India occupies the top spot in milk production in the world and contributes 19% to world milk production. Milk production has grown by 23.69% in 2014-18.", "url": "http://www.indiancooperative.com/dairy/maha-crisis-govt-offers-soft-loan-to-dairy-co-operatives/", "label": 1}
