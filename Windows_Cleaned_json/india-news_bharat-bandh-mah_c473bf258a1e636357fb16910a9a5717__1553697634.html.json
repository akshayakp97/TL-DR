(PTI)\nThe Maharashtra Congress Monday claimed that its \u2018Bharat Bandh\u2019 to protest against rising fuel prices was \u201c100 per cent successful and largely peaceful\u201d with all sections of the society, including traders, participating voluntarily. The party further said the ruling BJP was \u201cafraid\u201d of the protest and accused the government of trying to suppress the demonstration in the state. Addressing a press briefing in the evening, Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan lashed out at the Shiv Sena, an ally in the BJP-led governments at the state and the Centre, saying it was equally to blame for the price rise. He said Sena was \u201chelpless for power\u201d and that its \u201creal face stood exposed\u201d.\nChavan said the Sena has \u201cstopped roaring and is instead barking\u201d after it chose to refrain from supporting the protest in Mumbai. \u201cTheir leader Sanjay Raut said we woke up late on the people\u2019s issue. At least we woke up. There are posts on the social media that the Shiv Sena has stopped roaring and is instead barking,\u201d he said.\nThe Sena had taken a swipe at the Congress\u2019 bandh call in an editorial published in the former\u2019s mouthpiece Saamana Monday. Chavan thanked the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) for backing the agitation, but ruled out possibility of the Raj Thackeray-led party being a constituent of the grand-alliance of opposition parties the Congress is stitching together to take on the BJP.\n\u201cThe fuel price rise is unjust. Hence, we staged protest, which was 100 per cent successful. We got support from all sections of the people, including traders, voluntarily. The government tried to suppress the protest, but failed,\u201d he claimed.\nChavan denied that the bandh caused trouble to people, adding that the government had failed to keep its promises and hence \u201chad to go\u201d. Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam, who accompanied Chavan during the briefing, said the protest showed Mumbai could be shutdown without the Shiv Sena\u2019s support. \u201cI want the Shiv Sena to withdraw banners it hoisted in the city criticising the fuel price rise,\u201d he demanded. Nirupam also asked the Sena to walk out of the government if it intended to do something for the people.", "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-maharashtra-congress-says-stir-100-per-cent-successful/1309030/", "label": 1}
