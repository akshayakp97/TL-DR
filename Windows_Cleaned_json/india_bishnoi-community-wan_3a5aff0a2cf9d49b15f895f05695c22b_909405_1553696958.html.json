The community also sought a well-structured policy keeping in mind the growing incidents of poaching.\nThe community members, including some political and social leaders, assembled at \u2018Ravan Ka Chabootara\u2019 ground this morning under the banner of Akhil Bhartiya Bishnoi Mahasabha. The contention of the community is that Salman had not killed the Chinkaras, who else had done it.\nIn a memorandum addressed to the President of India and sbumitted to the district administration later, they demanded that the state government be directed to move an SLP in the Supreme Court against the High Court\u2019s order to acquit Khan in two cases of poaching.\nThey hoped that \u201cgood sense\u201d will prevail on the government so that it moves the Supreme Court and does \u201cnot let go\u201d Salman with the acquittal by the High Court. \u201cBesides this, we have also urged the President to frame a suitable policy with stern punitive measures in keeping with the growing incidents of wildlife poaching,\u201d said the Mahasabha\u2019s spokesperson Kishan Bishnoi.", "url": "https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/bishnoi-community-wants-slp-in-sc-against-salmans-acquittal/909405", "label": 1}
