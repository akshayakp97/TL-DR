This, despite the Centre reducing petrol prices. The surcharge on petrol is now \u20b911 and the State Congress will protest against this,\u201d senior party leader and former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said on Friday. Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam added that the party will hold demonstrations in Mumbai on May 26.\nEarlier this week, the Devendra Fadnavis government increased surcharge on petrol by \u20b92, which coincided with a reduction in petrol prices by \u20b92.16 by the Central government. Also, the increase in surcharge comes barely four weeks after the State government announced a hike in petrol prices. \u201cThere is no proper financial planning and the state\u2019s expenditure is mounting. The common man is at the receiving end because of a slew of taxes,\u201d Mr. Chavan claimed.\nThe State government is staring at losses well beyond the budget estimate of \u20b94,511 crore in revenue deficit. It stands to lose around \u20b97,000 crore in revenue after the Supreme Court ban on sale of liquor within 500 metres of national highways came into force. When taken together with the extra amount to be spent on salaries when the Seventh Pay Commission\u2019s recommendations are implemented, the government is apparently at wit\u2019s end to make ends meet.\nIt is facing embarrassment after the State Cabinet decision to hike stamp duty on gift deeds from \u20b9500 to a steep 3% of the property\u2019s market value was rolled back on Thursday, barely 72 hours after it was announced. According to sources, the pressure came from within the coalition from the Shiv Sena.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/govt-comes-under-attack-for-financial-indiscipline/article18511614.ece", "label": 1}
