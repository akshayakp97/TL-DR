They come out on the streets and protest against any wrongdoings.\nIn today's India, protests are fast turning into violent episodes of mass killings. The latest is the case of deaths of at least 10 innocent persons due to indiscriminate firing by the police during an anti-Sterlite rally in Tamil Nadu's Thoothukudi on Tuesday.\nCongress president Rahul Gandhi termed the deaths of several people in police firing during protests against the Sterlite copper plant in the southern state a \"brutal example of state-sponsored terrorism.\"\n\"The gunning down by the police of 9 people in the Sterlite protest in Tamil Nadu is a brutal example of state sponsored terrorism. These citizens were murdered for protesting against injustice. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of these martyrs and the injured,\" Rahul wrote on Twitter.\nThe gunning down by the police of 9 people in the #SterliteProtest in Tamil Nadu, is a brutal example of state sponsored terrorism. These citizens were murdered for protesting against injustice. My thoughts & prayers are with the families of these martyrs and the injured. \u2014 Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) May 22, 2018\nTamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has ordered a judicial inquiry into the police action.\nThe police action followed months-long protests for the closure of Vedanta's Sterlite copper unit in Thoothukudi over pollution concerns. The agitation turned violent on Tuesday, with protesters fighting pitched battles with police, prompting it to open fire.\nSeveral people took to Twitter to express their shock, anger and bereavement over the loss of innocent lives. Many have termed the whole macabre episode as genocide, well-planned to help big corporates to carry on with their money-minting projects without any hiccups.\nSeveral raised questions over the decision of the police to use assault rifles to open fire against unarmed Sterlite protesters. The deaths of so many people in Tamil Nadu reminded others of Kashmir, where protesters have often been silenced by bullets.\nHere we bring you a few tweets highlighting the police brutality:\nRapist Ram Rahim supporters\nburned down Panchkula - No firing\nKarni Sena goons went on a rampage and burned down vehicles and even attacked school buses - No firing\nPublic protest over environmental pollution : Police shot & killed 9 !\n#SterliteProtest \u2014 FYI (@_NairFYI) May 22, 2018\nSLR & AK47 used to open fire against #Sterlite protesters????
