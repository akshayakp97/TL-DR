The Bill had re-ignited Mizo nationalism and brought to the fore an anti-India feeling which was seen in the protest rally,\u201d Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Lallianchhunga, told The Shillong Times on Thursday.\nFurther underlining the Congress leader\u2019s seriousness when in power, the PCC spokesperson said, \u201cIn fact, on June 12, 2018, his council of ministers passed a resolution against the Bill while the Mizoram Legislative Assembly under his leadership passed another resolution against the legislation later that month.\u201d\nLast month, posters reading \u201cHello China, Bye Bye India\u201d, were carried by anti-CAB protesters in Aizawl.\n\u201cWe (Mizoram people) were always ready for a do-or-die battle if CAB was passed as it was a question of life and death. But luckily, the Bill has lapsed now after the Centre failed to table it in Rajya Sabha yesterday,\u201d Lallianchhunga said.\nReflecting on history, he said, \u201cWe still remember what happened in 1966 when Aizawl was bombed. The government of India never apologised for it unlike its apology to the Sikh community in 1984-85 (after the riots).\u201d\nOn the role of Mizoram chief minister, Zoramthanga in opposing the Bill, Lallianchhunga said the ruling Mizo National Front had opposed the Bill \u201conly in words\u201d and \u201cnever threatened to come out of the NEDA or break ties with NDA over the legislation.\u201d\n\u201cUnlike Meghalaya chief minister, Conrad Sangma who was not only very vocal and active against CAB but maintained a clear stand throughout, our chief minister (Zoramthanga) only opposed the Bill in words and defended his position,\u201d the Mizoram PCC spokesperson alleged.", "url": "http://www.theshillongtimes.com/2019/02/14/mizoram-cong-defends-ex-cms-banner-protest/", "label": 1}
