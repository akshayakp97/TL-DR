Vala, the former finance minister in the BJP government in Gujarat, has represented Rajkot for several terms as an MLA.\nAdvertising\nOn Friday, Congress workers burnt effigies of what they called symbolising the \u201cmisuse of power\u2019\u2019 by the Modi government at the Centre and BJP president Amit Shah. There was, however, no incident of violence reported from anywhere.\nState Congress president Amit Chavda and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Paresh Dhanani, who are currently touring various districts and meeting the local party leaders, attended the dharna in Tapi district.\nIn Ahmedababd, the state level dharna was held at Lal Darwaza which was attended by former state party president Arjun Modhwadia and party\u2019s sitting MLA Himmatsinh Patel, Ahmedabad city congress committee president Chetan Raval and others.\nAddressing party workers, Modhwadia said that by inviting BJP\u2019s B S Yeddyurappa to take oath as Karnataka chief minister, Governor Vala tried to \u201csubvert the democracy\u201d.\nHe said that the Congress-JD(S) combine had submitted the Karnataka Governor the list of MLAs which was more than the required number to form the government. \u201cBy doing so, he (Vala) has not only undermined the dignity of his office but has also acted in an unconstitutional manner,\u201d said Modhwadia.\n\u201cThe action of the Karnataka Governor is a dangerous precedent striking at the very heart of India\u2019s democracy and it portends grave consequences for all forthcoming elections,\u201d Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said.\nHe, however, added that the Friday\u2019s decision of the Supreme Court asking the BJP to prove its majority on the floor of the Assembly within 24 hours \u201chas come as a big intervention to protect democracy and exposed BJP leaders as also the Karnataka Governor\u2019\u2019.\nMeanwhile, a group of Congress workers assembled outside the home of Vala in Rajkot and shouted slogans against him. Police said that they have detained 30 Congress protesters.\nCongress city unit chief Mahesh Rajput, who led the protest outside Vala\u2019s Nutan Nagar society residence near Kalavad Road here, called the Karnataka governor\u2019s act a \u201cblot on the democracy\u201d. \u201cDespite being the Governor of a state, Vala has acted like a BJP worker,\u201d Rajput said.\nDeputy Commissioner of Police Harshad Mehta said, \u201cWe have detained 30 Congress workers from outside the residence of the Karnataka Governor. No member of Vala\u2019s family was at home when the protest and sloganeering took place.\u201d", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/elections/gujarat-across-state-congress-protests-against-karnataka-governor-30-detained-from-outside-valas-home-5182544/", "label": 1}
