They have been identified as Rajapandian, 31, of Tiruvallur, Samuthradevi, 35, of Alandur, Manikandan, 28 of Trichy and Leo Nelson, 32 of Chromepet.Rajapandian and Manikandan told the police that they had come to Marina Beach to participate in the protest, while the other two said that they were usual visitors to the beach. Police let them go after an inquiry. Hundreds of vendors had also kept away from Marina Beach.Deputy commissioner of Mylapore V Balakrishnan told TOI that such rumours affected the normal life of the public visiting the beach and those running shops. \u201cThose spreading such unnecessary rumours will face legal action,\u201d he said.Debt-ridden and drought-hit Tamil Nadu farmers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since mid-March, in different ways, to draw attention to their plight.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-police-thwart-marina2-0-protest-move/articleshow/57877738.cms", "label": 1}
