The survey was not representative but drew half a million responses.\nWith a small stock of smaller notes available and people struggling to get hold of scarce new 500 and 2,000 rupee bills, consumers are holding back spending and businesses are suffering.\nDelays in replacing cancelled notes and restrictions on cash withdrawals \u201creflect very poorly\u201d on Modi\u2019s team, the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India, Singh said.\nIn the year to March 2017, the cash crunch is expected to pull down economic growth from last year\u2019s 7.6 percent by as much as 4.1 percentage points, brokerage Ambit Capital reckons.\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service on Thursday warned the persistent cash crunch could worsen asset quality at Indian banks.", "url": "http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/indias-reform-architect-trashes-pm-modis-cash-crackdown/", "label": 1}
