Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had introduced the Delhi School (Verification of Accounts and Refund of Excess Fee) Bill and the Delhi School Education (Amendment) Bill in the Legislative Assembly two weeks ago. The House accepted both Bills with unanimous majority.\nAdvertising\nProtesters raised concerns over two issues \u2014 the deletion of Section 10(1) that ensured equal salaries for private and government teachers and enactment of the fee verification bill.\n\u201cSection 10 mandated that salaries and other benefits of employees of a recognised private school will not be less than that given to government school teachers. With the deletion of Section 10(1), these teachers will now be left at the mercy of the school management,\u201d said Ashok Agarwal, national president, All India Parents\u2019 Association.\nAgarwal also criticised the second bill. \u201cIt is a total eyewash. Private schools submitted their accounts to the Directorate of Education earlier as well, but nothing came of it. The legislation only gives more power to private schools to hike their fees as and when they like,\u201d he said.\nAdvertising\nTeachers too expressed disappointment over the move. \u201cThis is creating a division between government and private school teachers, making the former second class teachers in the setup. What is the rationale?\u201d said Roohi Rahman, a teacher at Hamdard Public School.\n\u201cPrivate school teachers are already an exploited lot. With Section 10 (1) being dropped, we will lose the basic legal right to get salary equal to our government counterparts\u2026,\u201d said Asma Syed, another teacher.\nEven as schools have welcomed the changes, activists and experts have expressed apprehension. \u201cThe government should have followed a graded approach to divide schools when it comes to giving salaries for teachers. As far as the fee verification bill is concerned, there is nothing new. We were submitting details earlier, we will do the same now. Those found bungling rightfully deserve punishment,\u201d said S K Bhattacharya, president, action committee of unaided private schools.\n\u201cThe bill presupposes that a fee-hike by private schools is per-se legal and valid, unless the same is challenged through a complaint and is set aside by the committee. If we look at the existing acts on private unaided school-fee regulation, particularly the Tamil Nadu (Regulation of Collection of Fee) Act, 2009, there is a stipulation of prior approval by the committee before fee-hike. The said hiked fee, once approved, cannot be hiked further up to three years. In this bill\u2026 the entire burden is upon the complainant. It was expected that Delhi\u2019s Act should be an advancement over Tamil Nadu\u2019s\u2026 But this bill falls way short..,\u201d said Khagesh Jha, activist and lawyer, about the fee refund bill.", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/changes-in-education-system-parents-teachers-hit-protest-note/", "label": 1}
