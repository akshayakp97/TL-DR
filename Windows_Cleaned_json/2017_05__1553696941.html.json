The rally is likely to witness the attendance of the who\u2019s who of a number of non-BJP parties.\n\u201cLaluji has been busy for last few days with his coterie at 10, Circular Road \u2014 his official residence \u2014 to prepare a strategy for a grand alliance of non-BJP parties.\n\u201cSince his proximity to Sonia Gandhi is well known and the Congress is still the second-most powerful national political party after the BJP, Laluji has decided to work for the unity of non-BJP parties by meeting her and taking her party along to ensure that the idea translates into reality,\u201d an RJD leader close to the party chief told IANS here.\nThis is Lalu\u2019s first move to personally call on a top leader of a non-BJP party after the ruling party\u2019s massive victory in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, which has led to panic among regional parties as well as the Congress.\nLast week, Lalu had a telephonic interaction with Sonia Gandhi in connection with the unity plan. After that he had said the Congress was a national party and it should come forward to unite and lead non-BJP parties.\nLalu has already called up West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and invited her to his party\u2019s rally, apart from Bahujan SamajParty (BSP) supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav \u2014 both former Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh.\n\u201cLaluji is also in touch with DMK in Tamil Nadu, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and the leaders of Left parties to ensure unity of non-BJP parties,\u201d another RJD leader said.\nWhen asked about his proposed rally in Patna and his bid to exhibit opposition unity, Lalu said: \u201cI have invited top leaders of all non-BJP parties for my rally in August. All of them will attend it.\u201d\nKeeping the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in focus, he has been appealing to all non-BJP parties to come together to counter the \u201caggressive Hindutva agenda\u201d of the BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party\u2019s President Amit Shah.\nSensing a tough challenge, Lalu has also cautioned the non-BJP parties that a united opposition would be the only option to take on the BJP and Narendra Modi in the next general elections.\n\u201cUnity among non-BJP parties is the only mantra now to defeat the BJP. If non-BJP parties remain divided and fail to unite as a political force, they will be finished,\u201d he said.\nLalu\u2019s major ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has already said that a \u201cMahagathbandhan\u201d (grand alliance) of non-BJP parties was needed at the national level to defeat the BJP in the next parliamentary polls.\nAt a time when Lalu and his family, including his two sons and elder daughter, are under attack for benami property worth Rs 1,000 crore by the IT Department, Lalu appears to be playing it cool.\nRefuting media reports about his and his family\u2019s involvement in the alleged benami property deals, he also vowed recently to \u201cuproot\u201d the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre before it completes its five-year term.\n\u201cListen, you BJP and RSS people, Lalu will drag you off the seat of power in Delhi, no matter what happens to me. Get it straight\u2026 Don\u2019t you dare threaten me,\u201d he said.\nDoes Lalu, a man known for pulling off surprises in the past, including enthroning his wife Rabri Devi as proxy Chief Minister of Bihar when he faced the fodder scam, have something up his sleeves again? Political watchers in the state don\u2019t rule out the possibility.", "url": "http://indianewengland.com/2017/05/bihar-lalu-play-grand-alliance-card-delhi/", "label": 1}
