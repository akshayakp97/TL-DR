Its creed is violence, but Sitaram Yechury in Delhi talks of liberal democracy,\" Sinha told ANI.\n\"I think the Government of India should take cognizance of growing violence in Kannur. Almost 250 Swayamsevaks have been killed till now,\" he added.\nThe BJP's Kerala unit today staged a protest outside the secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram against the murder of a party worker in Kannur.\nThe BJP has called for a shutdown in the state to protest against the murder of its activist allegedly by the CPI-M members in Pinarayi village in Kannur district.\nThe BJP, which has demanded a CBI probe into the murder, has also accused Kerala's Left Democratic Front government and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of unleashing \"political terrorism\" in Kerala.
