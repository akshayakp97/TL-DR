But for most Africans, it is anything but an exemplary tale, which is why a statue of the Indian independence leader was recently removed from the University of Ghana, following complaints about his offensive remarks about the South African community.\nThe petition, submitted by students and faculty, cited his writings, where he called Indians \u201cinfinitely superior\u201d to black Africans. Several such writings which came to light only recently prove that Gandhi, who had practised law in the continent early in his career, and is renowned for having fought against the apartheid, was, in fact, racist.\nThe statue was located in the country\u2019s capital, Accra.\nHere\u2019s what the petition said\nAfter relentless protests at the prestigious Legon campus, the statue was removed overnight on Tuesday, two years after former president Pranab Mukherjee unveiled it to consolidate diplomatic ties between both nations.\nThe petition quoted extensively from his letters and journals, where he repeatedly used a racist diminutive \u201ckafir\u201d to address Africans. One particular excerpt read thus\nOurs is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.\nA 2015 book highlighted other instances of deeply internalised and systemic racism that Gandhi subscribed to, while working on civil rights issues in South Africa for more than two decades. According to the book, Gandhi complained that Indians were being forced to use the same separate entrances as Africans, meaning \u201ctheir civilised habits \u2026 would be degraded to the habits of aboriginal natives\u201d, suggesting that presumed Indians to be socially superior to native communities in South Africa.\nHis ignorance and prejudice has perhaps taken this long to be regarded seriously because Gandhi\u2019s theories of civil resistance, ahimsa and austerity are still revered all over the world, and he has inspired generations of activists including Martin Luther King Jr.\nHere\u2019s what the agitators and authorities said\nThe controversy had begun almost immediately after the unveiling, prompting a statement from Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs which claimed, \u201cWhile acknowledging that human as he was, Mahatma Gandhi may have had his flaws, we must remember that people evolve. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.\u201d\nGhana\u2019s former government had apparently promised to relocate the statue so that the outcry and controversy around it didn\u2019t pose a distraction to Ghana\u2019s \u201cstrong ties of friendship\u201d with India, while also protecting the artwork itself. But it remained in place until this week.\nThe head of language, literature and drama at the Institute of African Studies, Obadele Kambon, told the press the removal had become a matter of \u201cself-respect\u201d.\nThe petition also demanded commemoration of Africa\u2019s own heroes. \u201cIf we show that we have no respect for ourselves and look down on our own heroes and praise others who had no respect for us, then there is an issue,\u201d Obadele said, asking, \u201cIf we indeed don\u2019t show any self-respect for our heroes, how can the world respect us?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a victory for black dignity and self-respect. The campaign has paid off,\u201d he said, as a student Benjamin Mensah, chimed in, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a massive win for all Ghanaians because it was constantly reminding us of how inferior we are.\u201d\nAlthough the university told the BBC that Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration was responsible for the statue\u2019s removal, an official from the ministry refused to comment saying the removal was \u201can internal decision by the university\u201d.\nA recurrence\nThis is not the first instance in the continent when people have protested the glorification of Gandhi. Earlier this year, a proposed statue of Mahatma Gandhi stirred up a similar controversy in Blantyre, the commercial capital of Malawi. Around 3,000 petitioners from the town forged a front known as Gandhi Must Fall (GMF), and wrote to the government opposing the project, saying, \u201cHe never did anything for us.\u201d\nThe agitators also claimed that the statue was being forced upon the people of Malawi and \u201cis the work of a foreign power aiming at promoting its image and dominion on the unsuspecting people of Malawi\u201d.\nWhile history knows Gandhi as a fervent champion of South Africans, and for fighting segregation laws in the country during the apartheid era, Wonderful Mkutche, a member of GMF told AFP on Saturday, \u201cWe are not comfortable with imperialistic and neo-colonial ideologies that seek to impose \u2026 foreign influence which deprives us of honour.\u201d\n\u201cNow more than ever, our nation must rise above pettiness and weakness in international deals,\u201d he said. \u201cThis must mean that we should only accept investments, partnerships \u2026 that are responsible, fair, equal, honourable, sustainable, efficient and transparent,\u201d Mkutche further added.\nMeanwhile, controversy over Gandhi\u2019s views about Africans has seen rallying on both sides. A spokesperson for the Malawai foreign ministry defended the project, saying, \u201cIt should be recognised that Mahatma Gandhi promoted values of simplicity, fight against social evils, promoting human and civil rights as well as uplifting of social well-being of people.\u201d\nMunlo insisted, \u201cIt is also worth noting that all African freedom fighters that fought against colonialism and oppression and thus demanded independence were influenced by what Mahatma Gandhi fought for. In other ways, Mahatma Gandhi is a role model of a human rights campaigner for both Africa and India.\u201d\nPrarthana Mitra is a staff writer at Qrius.", "url": "https://qrius.com/after-malawi-ghana-university-removes-gandhi-statue-for-his-racism/", "label": 1}
