Khan was arrested on February 24 on charges of raping a Naga girl.Khan was a resident of Assam\u2019s Karimganj district. There was widespread anger and protests against Khan\u2019s lynching with many political parties in Assam demanding that the Nagaland government reveal the truth behind the incident.The governor said Assam, Tripura and Nagaland are facing the problem of influx of illegal immigrants and the governments and people of these states should be more alert while dealing with the situation.The governor also urged people to cooperate with the investigating agency in bringing out the truth.
