According to tradition, the country's biggest awards are given by the President at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Similarly, since this was the state's biggest award, we decided to hold it here,\" Fadnavis said. Fadnavis said the Maharashtra government would provide financial support to those who make movies focusing on Shivaji's work as a \"management guru\".\nHT column | Award to Babasaheb Purandare: Political row over Shivaji, once again\nMeanwhile, protestors claimed that Purandare tarnished the image of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji by casting aspersions on the warrior king's parentage and the role played by his guru Dadaji Konddev.\nOn Tuesday, members of the Maratha group Sambhaji Brigade, had vandalised Maharashtra minister of state for home Ram Shinde's office in Ahmednagar district to protest against the decision to confer the award on Purandare.\nPurandare, who is referred to as \"Shiv Shahir\" or 'Shivaji's poet', has also being criticised for assisting controversial American author James Laine write his book 'Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India', which had allegedly made controversial inferences about Shivaji's mother Jijabai and his mentor Dadaji Konddev.\nPurandare, who was born on 19 August, 1921, started writing about the life of Shivaji from a very young age.\nHe is known for his books like Raja Shiv Chhatrapati, Purandaryanchi Daulat, Purandaryanchi Naubat and Gadsanch which are considered masterpieces on the life and times of the 16th century Maratha warrior king.\nWhile the Congress and the NCP opposed the Maharashtra government's decision to give him the award, the BJP, the Shiv Sena and the MNS backed the move.\nNCP MP from Satara Udayanraje Bhosle, who is also a descendant of Shivaji, recently asked the state government to put off the award ceremony until allegations against Purandare are verified.\nAccusing NCP supremo Sharad Pawar of playing caste politics, MNS president Raj Thackeray had said that the Maratha strongman is indulging in dirty politics over the issue.\nMeanwhile, the Bombay high court rejected a petition today, seeking a direction to the Maharashtra state government to withdraw its decision to confer the award on Purandare and it also also imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 on petitioners.\nAlso read: HC rejects plea against Maharashtra Bhushan award to Purandare\nFirst Published: Aug 19, 2015 21:51 IST", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/maharashtra-confers-state-s-highest-honour-on-writer-purandare/story-MVvOw9Z9rXkAe7nWnWzDHL.html", "label": 1}
