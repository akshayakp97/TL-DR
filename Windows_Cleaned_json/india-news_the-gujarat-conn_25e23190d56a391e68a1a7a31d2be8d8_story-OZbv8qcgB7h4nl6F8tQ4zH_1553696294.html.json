( PTI )\nThe legislators held a protest in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue there against the raids on Shivakumar\u2019s properties, calling it a BJP ploy to threaten them.\n\u201cThere have been many attempts to spread false information,\u201d Gohil said. \u201cSome news organisations have said that the MLAs are being kept at the resort against their will, that some have expressed a desire to leave. But there is no such thing,\u201d Gohil said.\nThe legislator said the MLAs had come to state with the only aim of protecting democracy. \u201cThe BJP wants to spread an atmosphere of fear,\u201d he added.\nI-T Raids End at Minister\u2019s House\nEarlier in the day, Shivakumar, who came out of his house after the four-day long raid, thanked party leaders for their support.\n\u201cI will speak as soon as the I-T department releases its report on the raids,\u201d he said, adding that he would head to the resort where the Gujarat MLAs are staying.\nKarnataka energy minister D K Shivakumar speaks to media after income tax sleuths completed a four-day long raid at his residence in Bengaluru, on Saturday. ( Arijit Sen/HT Photo )\nLater in the day, the minister also apologised for adverse remarks made by his mother against chief minister Siddarmaiah on Thursday. Shivakumar\u2019s mother had accused Siddarmaiah of targeting her son.\nIn a letter, Shivakumar apologised on behalf of his \u201cuneducated\u201d mother, saying she was unaware about whose jurisdiction the I-T department came under.\n\u201cI would like to tender my apology to the chief minister and the people of the state for the remarks made by my mother,\u201d Shivakumar\u2019s letter says. \u201cSome media organisations used my mother\u2019s innocence to make her say these things,\u201d he alleged.\nMeanwhile, Siddaramaiah criticised the BJP over the raids, saying they were politically motivated. \u201cThe Central Reserve Police Force being used for raids at the house of our cabinet minister is against the Constitution. This should have been done only if there was a collapse of the law and order situation in the state,\u201d he said.\nSiddarmaiah said the I-T department was free to raid anybody. \u201cLet them also raid BJP leaders. Are there no cases against [BJP state president] BS Yeddyurappa, [Union ministers] DV Sadananda Gowda and Ananth Kumar?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWe will politically oppose moves done with a political vendetta,\u201d the chief minister said.\nFirst Published: Aug 05, 2017 20:47 IST", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-gujarat-connection-when-congress-mlas-met-karnataka-governor-vajubhai-vala/story-OZbv8qcgB7h4nl6F8tQ4zH.html", "label": 1}
