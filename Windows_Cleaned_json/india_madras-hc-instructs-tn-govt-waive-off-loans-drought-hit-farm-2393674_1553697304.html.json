Because of the ongoing agricultural crisis, several farmers in the state, unable to repay loans taken from banks and private money lenders, committed suicide in the recent past.\nAccording to an estimate, the crisis in the agriculture sector in Tamil Nadu has reached a mammoth proportion. Since October last year, every day, two farmers are committing suicide in the state, say reports.\nSince March 14, a group of 80-odd farmers from Tamil Nadu are protesting at Jantar Mantar in Delhi demanding financial relief as they have lost their crops and savings in the ongoing drought in the state. The peaceful agitation has brought a lot of attention as the farmers are protesting with skulls.\n\"We are going to continue the protest indefinitely until the Centre fulfils all our demands. The state government has sought Rs 39,565 crore as drought relief from the National Disaster Response Fund. But the central team has recommended a paltry sum of Rs 2,096.80 crore as drought relief. It is grossly inadequate. The state has witnessed an unprecedented drought in the last 150 years and the whole state has been declared drought-hit,\" South Indian Rivers Inter-Linking Farmers Association president P Ayyakannu who is leading the protest, said.\nOneIndia News", "url": "https://www.oneindia.com/india/madras-hc-instructs-tn-govt-waive-off-loans-drought-hit-farm-2393674.html", "label": 1}
