In Andhra alone, out of all farmer suicides, more than 90% of them were tenant farmers,\" he said.\nHe went on to criticise the state government, adding, \"In the name of building a new capital, thousands of acres are being forcefully taken by them.\"\nN Ranga Rao said, \"There is no point in releasing Pattiseema waters for irrigation if loans are not given to the farmers first.\"\nHe also claimed, \u201cOut of Rs 574 crore of farmer debts that need to be cleared, the state government has gotten away by waiving just Rs 144 crore.\"\nHe demanded that the government follow the recommendations of the Sri Radhakrishna Commission, which would benefit the tenant farmers.\nSpeaking at the event several other leaders criticised the state government, for implementing its anti-farmer policies.\nThere was also ruckus at the public meeting later in the day, as a constable who was in civilian clothes, was allegedly attacked by the activists near the stage, following a heated exchange.\nHowever, participants at the venue alleged that the constable had deliberately picked up a fight by intimidating them and seeking their personal details and addresses, while also videotaping the event.\nAfter the event, the police picked up some of the leaders and took them to the local police station. They were later let off.", "url": "https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/angry-being-neglected-andhra-govt-tenant-farmers-gather-vijayawada-protest-64753", "label": 1}
