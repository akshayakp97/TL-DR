They (BJP) looted while in power,\u201d Siddaramaiah told reporters.\nAnnouncing the \u2018Bengaluru Rakshisi Padayatre\u2019, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said the BJP would visit all 28 constituencies in the city and call upon the people to root out the Congress.\nThe 14-day yatra will criss-cross Bengaluru with a call to save the city from \u201cCongress\u2019 misrule\u201d and revive the BJP, the party\u2019s State unit said on its official Twitter handle.\nThis is the second march launched by the party, the first being the 85-day \u201cParivarthana Yatra\u201d that concluded on February 4. That yatra had travelled to all 224 Assembly constituencies in the State and virtually sounded the poll bugle.\nReleasing a booklet carrying the \u201cfailures\u201d of the Congress government, Javadekar alleged that Bengaluru had been reduced to \u201cgarbage city and crime city\u201d ever since Siddaramaiah took over as Chief Minister.\nThe BJP also brought out a Bengaluru specific \u201ccharge-sheet\u201d against the Congress. \u201cThe charge-sheet is an eye-opener. A decent city has been converted into a crime city. Now it\u2019s \u2018Goonda Raaj\u2019 when we see the happenings in the last one month,\u201d the Union Minister said.\nGoondas were attacking police, robbing their houses and snatching their revolvers in Bengaluru, he alleged. \u201cOnce considered the safest city for women, Bengaluru has become the most unsafe city today due to increasing cases of rape, abduction and chain snatching. This is the transformation done by Congress under Siddaramaiah,\u201d he said.\nTaking on the the saffron party, State Home minister Ramalinga Reddy referred to various incidents where those associated with the BJP were allegedly involved in violent acts. He said action had been taken in all cases, including one in which a Congress MLA\u2019s son was involved.\n\u201cWhen we came to power, BJP that was in power earlier had left Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (city civic body) with \u20b98,000 crore in debt...we need to save people of Bengaluru from BJP, as they are the ones who are goondas,\u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/under-congress-crime-rife-in-bengaluru-says-bjp/article22896858.ece", "label": 1}
