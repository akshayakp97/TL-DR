Section 144 and suspension of Internet services were imposed on May 23 after the violence.\nThe protests that were continuing for the last three months turned violent on May 22 when protestors allegedly hurled stones at police forces, prompting them to open fire. The locals have alleged that the plant of Sterlite Copper is responsible for rising levels of pollution and they have been demanding its closure.\nLast week, the Madras High court in its interim order had stayed the expansion plans of the plant. The court also asked the state government to protect the bodies of those killed on May 22 protests.\nThe state government has formed a judicial commission headed by retired High Court judge Justice Aruna Jagadeesan to probe the police firing. Meanwhile, NHRC (National Human Rights Commission) has also issued a notice to the state government over the death of people killed in police firing. The commission has asked the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police (DGP) to file a reply within two weeks.
