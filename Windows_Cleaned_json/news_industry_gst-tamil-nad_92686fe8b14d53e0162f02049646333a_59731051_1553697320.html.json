They will place our requests to the GST council.\u201dThe traders association feels that only if the requests are made in the initial days of the GST regime, they will be able to get them fulfilled. \u201cWe hope our demands are heard in the first three-four months,\u201d said Kumaran.The traders association want the revenue cap for tax being upped from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore. \u201cThere are many traders in the city and the state who will get affected because of this. The GST council should consider this,\u201d said association district vice-president T Soundararaj. Soundararaj pointed out that Tamil Nadu had exempted 589 grocery items from tax until GST was implemented. \u201cUnder GST, nearly 500 of these 589 products are being taxed. The tax ranges from 5% to 28%. This has impacted the traders as well as the common man,\u201d said Soundararaj.\u201cWe are also creating awareness among the public about the new tax rates on the products under the GST,\u201d he added.The traders association has prepared a 10-point memorandum that will be handed over to the state government to be placed in front of the GST council.\u201cIf our demands are not heard, then we will go on a day-long strike on August 8,\u201d said Soundararaj.", "url": "https://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/gst-tamil-nadu-traders-association-to-stage-protest-in-chennai-on-july-25/59731051", "label": 1}
