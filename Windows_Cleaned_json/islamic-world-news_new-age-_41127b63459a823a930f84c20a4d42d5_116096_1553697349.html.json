to withdraw criticism of Saudi human rights record\nAug 9, 2018\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his country will not withdraw its criticism of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record, rebuffing a call by the kingdom\u2019s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir.\nThe Canadian PM made the remarks at a Wednesday press conference in Montreal, stressing that his country will \u201cspeak strongly and clearly\u201d wherever it sees the need on questions of human rights.\nHis comments came shortly after Jubeir told reporters in Riyadh that Ottawa must recant its criticism of Riyadh\u2019s decision to imprison two Saudi women\u2019s rights activists if it seeks reconciliation with the kingdom.\nThe criticism had been raised last week by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who condemned the Al Saud regime for detaining Nassima al-Sadah and Samar Badawi, the latter of whom has family ties to Canada.\nTrudeau told the presser that his country always maintains constructive and positive ties with other nations across the world, but at the same time it must ensure human rights concerns are brought up.\nThat is \u201cbecause Canadians expect that, and indeed people around the world expect that leadership from Canada,\u201d he noted, stressing that his country will continue to stand up for human rights in all parts of the world in a \u201cpolite and constructive\u201d way.\nThe US, which claims to be an advocate of human rights in the world, has yet to support Canada in its tension with Saudi Arabia. However, Trudeau said he cannot \u201cimpose on other countries what their responses and reaction should be.\u201d\nHe added that he \u201crespects the rights of other countries to speak for themselves.\u201d\nThe Riyadh-Ottawa diplomatic brawl has already led to the expulsion of the Canadian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and recalling of the Saudi envoy from Canada.\nSaudis have also suspended all flights to and from the North American state, halted their trade with the country, and ordered its students studying in Canada and patients receiving treatment there to go elsewhere by the next month.\nhttps://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/08/09/570611/Canada-criticism-Saudi-human-rights\n--------\nSaudi-Backed IsDB Ready to Help Imran-Led Govt with $4 Billion Loan\nAugust 10, 2018\nKARACHI: Pakistan plans to borrow more than $4 billion from the Saudi-backed Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) as part of its attempts to restore dangerously low stocks of foreign currency, reported The Financial Times on Thursday.\nTwo officials told the daily that the Jeddah-based bank had agreed to make a formal offer to lend Islamabad the money when Imran Khan took over as prime minister. They added that they expected Asad Umar \u2014 Mr Khan\u2019s proposed finance minister \u2014 to accept the offer.\n\u201cThe paperwork is all in place,\u201d said one senior adviser in Islamabad. \u201cThe IsDB is waiting for the elected government to take charge before giving their approval,\u201d the report quoted the official as saying.\nThe official added that the loan would not cover Pakistan\u2019s expected financing gap of at least $25bn during this financial year but was \u201can important contribution\u201d.\nSpeaking to reporters in Islamabad this week, Mr Umar had warned: \u201cThe situation is dire. We\u2019ve got 10bn dollars of central bank reserves, [and] we\u2019ve got somewhere between $8bn and $9bn in short-term liabilities, and therefore your net reserves are close to nothing.\u201d\nAs per the newspaper report, officials have already drawn up plans to borrow up to $12bn from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 though such a bailout is likely to come with strings attached, such as a demand to see the details behind billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese loans.\nMr Umar, it added, was therefore exploring what other options remained open to him, of which the IsDB loan was one. Officials said the loan would be used mainly to pay for oil imports, with higher crude prices having contributed to the country\u2019s problems. One official at Pakistan\u2019s central bank \u2014 who has been involved in negotiations with the IsDB \u2014 said the loan had the backing of the Saudi government, \u201cwhich wants to play a part in rescuing Pakistan from its present crisis\u201d.\nDespite the promise of money from the IsDB, economists warn that Mr Khan\u2019s government will still have to enact potentially unpopular spending cuts and tax rises to help repair the government\u2019s balance sheet.\n\u201cThe budget deficit shot up to about 7 per cent of gross domestic product during the last financial year,\u201d Waqar Masood Khan, a former finance ministry official told FT. \u201cBringing that down to the target of 4 per cent is not going to be easy,\u201d the report added, quoting the official.\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1426093/saudi-backed-isdb-ready-to-help-imran-led-govt-with-4-billion-loan\n--------\nApplied Islamics will revolutionize Islamic Studies: Mahmood Madani, Rahman Khan\nAugust 9, 2018\nMangaluru (Karnataka): The inaugural programme of the Post Graduate Diploma in Applied Islamics was organised at Yenepoya University, Mangaluru (Karnataka) on 9th August 2018 at 10 am. The programme has been initiated by Chair in Islamic Studies and Research under Dr. Javed Jamil.\nInaugurating the programme Mohamood Madani, General Secretary Jamiat e Ulema Hind, described it as the \u2018need of the time \u2018and stressed that Islam is meant for the welfare of the whole humanity. He praised the syllabus of the proposed course and described it as an ideal which will be followed by the whole world in future.\nChief Guest, former Minister of Minority Affairs, Rahman Khan lauded the efforts of Dr. Javed Jamil on presenting a new holistic vision, and congratulated Chancellor Abdulla Kunhi for taking the initiative.\nHe said that \u201cthe concept of Applied Islamics is wonderful\u201d and if Muslims learn its essence, a new evolution in Islamic studies will be witnessed.\nGuest of Honuor Ziaulla Sheriff stressed upon the students to work hard and to be familiar with all the aspects of life.\nIntroducing the course Dr. Javed Jamil said that all the religions need to come together on the basis of religious morality and not fight on the basis of religious identity.\nHe said that the principles of Islam can be applied in fields like Health Sciences, Social Sciences and National Sciences for the benefit of the whole world. He stressed that one should not study Islam in the light of modern sciences, but study the modern sciences in the light of Islam.\nVice Chancellor Dr. M. Vijayakumar gave thr introduction of Yenepoya University saying that PG Diploma in Applied Islamics is the 100th course started by the University.\nChancellor Y Abdulla Kunhi expressed his delight at the inauguration of the course. He said that the varsity's ultimate aim is to establish a big International centre of Applied Islamics\nPostgraduate Diploma in Applied Islamics, the course inaugurated today, is a unique course, first of its kind in the world, which will focus on Islamic analysis of the scientific and social developments in the modern world.\nAbout Applied Islamics\nApplied Islamics refers to the study of the application of Islamic Principles in the modern fields of knowledge like Law, Natural Sciences, Health Sciences and Social Sciences including Economics and Philosophy.\nIt comprises of the analysis of the modern theories in different fields in the light of Islamic principles and the development of the alternative terminologies, definitions, methodologies, indices, programmes, policies, models and paradigms consistent with Islamic teachings with an aim of helping a cleaner, healthier and more peaceful world.\nWhile subjects like Theology, Arabic and Islamic History are being taught in other places as well, it is the subject of Applied Islamics, which gives this course a very special place. It introduces an interdisciplinary approach.\nUnder the course, chapters on India\u2019s Constitution and the importance of its Secular and Democratic values and the international institutions will also be covered.\nIt will also have Comparative Religion as part of its course and will work for the coming together of all religions and religious communities on the basis of common religious morality rather than fighting each other on the ground of religious identity.\nhttp://www.ummid.com/news/2018/August/09.08.2018/applied-islamics-will-revolutionize-islamic-studies-mahmood-madani-rahman-khan.html\n--------\nThree members of UK grooming gang face possible deportation to Pakistan\nAUGUST 10, 2018\nThree members of a Rochdale grooming gang face possible deportation to Pakistan after Court of Appeal judges upheld a decision to strip them of their British citizenship, The Guardian reported on Wednesday.\nThey had acquired British citizenship by naturalisation.\nAbdul Aziz, Adil Khan and Qari Abdul Rauf were among nine men of Pakistani and Afghan descent convicted of luring girls as young as 13 into sexual encounters using alcohol and drugs. They were based in Rochdale, in northern England.\nThe three men were jailed in May 2012 but were later released on licence. The gang\u2019s ringleader, Shabir Ahmed, was sentenced to 22 years in jail and remains in custody.\nAziz, Khan and Rauf were convicted on conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation charges. Aziz was not convicted of having sexual intercourse with any child.\nThe case centres on a decision by Prime Minister Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to strip the men\u2019s citizenship \u201cfor the public good\u201d.\nThe men had challenged the government decision at two immigration tribunals, arguing revoking their citizenship would violate their human right to a family life, as they have children living in the UK. Their appeals were dismissed.\nThe convicts then approached the Court of Appeal, senior judges of which ruled on Wednesday that the previous tribunals had made a \u201cproper and lawful assessment\u201d of the likelihood of deportation. A person can be deprived of British citizenship for the public good on the grounds of \u201cinvolvement in terrorism, espionage, serious organised crime, war crimes or unacceptable behaviours\u201d.\nAfter serving their sentences, the three convicts will have a further legal right to appeal their deportation and the process could take months, according to the BBC.\nIt quoted a Home Office spokeswoman as saying: \u201cThis was an appalling case. We welcome the court\u2019s finding and will now consider next steps.\u201d The five victims of the gang who gave evidence in the 2012 trial were all white, and spoke of being raped, assaulted and traded for sex, being passed from man to man, and sometimes being too drunk to stop the abuses. The men, ranging in age from 22 to 59, used various defences, including claiming the girls were prostitutes.\nhttps://dailytimes.com.pk/280968/three-members-of-uk-grooming-gang-face-possible-deportation-to-pakistan/\n--------\nBangladeshi terror group Jamat ul mujahideen planning terror attacks in India and Myanmar\nAug 9, 2018\nBangladesh terror groups Jamat ul-Mujahideen (JMB) and Ansar ul Bangla Team (ABT) are planning to recruit in India, set up hideouts and procure weapons for terrorist activities in the country. These groups are also making efforts to established contact with radical Islamic groups in India with a view to widening their network. Disclosure of some arrested ABT cadre revealed that outfit has set up an organised network of radicalised local village youth in Assam and West Bengal.\nThe arrest of JMB terrorist and mastermind of Bodh Gaya blast Zahidul Islam revealed before NIA that JMB terrorists are planning to fight against Myanmar army in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. NIA recently arrested two accused including the mastermind of the Bodh Gaya blast. The arrested accused were involved of planting of IED at Kalchakra Maidan, Bodh Gaya, Bihar this year in January.\nThe arrested accused Zahidul Islam alias Kausar and Adil of West Bengal revealed that they were also planning to attack Myanmar by setting up JMB base in India. .Zahidul Islam is a Bangladeshi citizen and most wanted accused in serial blast cases in Bangladesh. He was also found involved in Trishal Police van attack in Bangladesh. He was sentenced to 95 years of imprisonment in total by the Bangladeshi courts and one murder case is still pending trial against him. In 2014 he escaped from custody in Bangladesh and illegally entered into India. He was part of JMB module involved in the preparation of IEDs in Burdwan.\nAs per the NIA sources, Zahidul Islam is the main bomb maker of JMB.He is an expert in making bombs. The arrest of Zahidul is a big success for investigating agencies. During the house search of Zahidul Islam, NIA team recovered electronic devices including traces of explosive from his house at Ramnagara, Bengaluru. Initial interrogation has also revealed that the group led by Zahidul Islam planned to cause IEDs explosion at Bodh Gaya to avenge the atrocities on Rohingyas in Myanmar.\nhttp://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bangladeshi-terror-group-jamat-ul-mujahideen-planning-terror-attack-in-india-and-myanmar-2647708\n--------\nNorth America\nFirst Hijabi US TV Reporter to Go On Air\n09 August 2018\nTahera Rahman knew her road to becoming the U.S.'s first hijab-wearing Muslim television reporter would be fraught with obstacles.\nAfter graduating from Loyola University Chicago her professors and colleagues would ask if she would be willing to take off her hijab, a headscarf often worn by Muslim women to cover their hair, to land a dream job in journalism. Her answer was consistently a firm \"No.\"\n\"My boss said \u2018that\u2019s fine I respect your decision, but just know that you\u2019re going to get a lot of no\u2019s,'\u201d Rahman, 27, told Anadolu Agency.\nAnd indeed the daughter of Indian and Pakistani immigrants did face rejection time and again, having her applications to newsrooms shot down in quick order, and forcing a revaluation of her career path.\nRather than directly seek a reporter position, Rahman chose to pursue a backdoor into the newsroom.\nShe eventually landed a producer position at WHBF-TV, a CBS-affiliated television station about three hours west of Chicago, Illinois.\nBut Rahman was not about to settle for a position behind the scenes. She was determined to make her way in front of a camera, firing off applications to internal openings as soon as she could find them, but was again met with the repeated rejection her mentors foresaw, eventually facing a crisis of confidence that only her mother could pull her back from.\nDurdana Rahman refused to let her daughter spiral into a void of despair, insisting Tahara work even harder to meet her goals.\n\u201cI wrote them an email, my bosses, and I said tell me how I can be the best candidate, tell me what I need to do. And I kept working hard and then I applied the third time and alhamdulillah I got the job, thank God,\u201d she said.\nShe first went on air Feb. 8 of this year, making history in the process.\nAfter her first broadcast the messages of support began rolling in from all across the world, from Mexico to the Netherlands, she said. Perhaps just importantly, Rahman has garnered the appreciation of those in her community.\nShe said she received one such message from a man in Iowa who said \"\u2018I\u2019m a father of two and I\u2019m Christian, but any time you\u2019re in Des Moines, I want you to come have dinner with my family, because I want my daughters to know who you are.\u201d\n\"The support has been amazing. I couldn\u2019t have expected anything better, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful,\u201d she said.\nRahman does not know where her career will lead, opining that it may lead to a job in national or international news. Ultimately, however, she is keeping an open mind.\n\"I just want to be able to tell people's stories and make some kind of a difference,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be an adventure no matter what, inshallah.\u201d\nhttp://www.worldbulletin.net/america-canada/204824/canada-plans-no-economic-retaliation-on-saudis\n--------\nAnti-Islam group postpones rally at Nathan Phillips Square\nAug. 9, 2018\nAn anti-Islam organization has postponed a rally scheduled for Saturday after drawing widespread condemnation from organizations and Toronto city councillors.\nThe World Coalition Against Islam, a Calgary-based far-right group, planned to gather at Nathan Phillips Square for what would have been its first rally in Ontario. It was set to mark the one-year anniversary of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a far-right protester rammed his car into the crowd.\nWCAI posted a public statement on Facebook Thursday afternoon calling people \u201csnowflakes\u201d for reacting negatively to the rally that was to fall the day before the anniversary of the fatal Charlottesville car attack, which the group says was a total coincidence.\n\u201cDue to people being snowflakes about the Aug. 11 date coincidentally being on the same day as Charlottesville last year and groups pulling out and there being a Bollywood festival scheduled at Nathan Phillips Square, I have decided to postpone the rally,\u201d the statement read.\nWCAI had an active presence in Calgary, where they were denied permits by city officials who cited the group\u2019s \u201chateful\u201d messages.\nCouncillor Kristyn Wong-Tam, whose ward includes Nathan Phillips Square, called the Aug. 11 rally \u201ca disappointing reminder that, as far as we have come as a society, many still cling to violent prejudice.\u201d\nIn her statement, Wong-Tam condemned the group, who she says \u201creject the very foundational values\u201d of the country, but added that she stands by their \u201cright to march and protest.\u201d\nMayor John Tory also spoke out Thursday. \u201cHatred and acts of violence against any identifiable group have no place in this city,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCity staff assure me that no permit has or will be issued for any rally in Nathan Phillips Square, regardless of when the hate rally is being organized for,\u201d he said in the statement.\nToronto city council spokesperson Paula Chung said the group did not apply for a permit to rally at the square, but didn\u2019t need to. Protesters and counterprotesters are both allowed to gather at the square, she said.\nSeveral groups also condemned the public appearance of WCAI. The Steelworkers\u2019 Toronto Area Council and the United Jewish People\u2019s Order were organizing a counterprotest in the same area.\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims, the Urban Alliance on Race Relations and other community organizations had planned to hold a news conference Friday at city hall to denounce the rally. The news conference has been cancelled in light of the postponement.\nIn a combined statement Thursday afternoon, the Muslim council and race relations alliance \u201cwelcomed\u201d the news that the rally had been rescheduled, but noted that postponing the rally means it could still happen at a later date.\n\u201cWhile we welcome the postponement of the planned rally, we note that the organizers have indicated the possibility of rescheduling it for a future date. As such, we will continue to monitor and alert our communities to any such event,\u201d said Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims.\n\u201cThe planning of this event, which was due to fall on the first anniversary of the racist, neo-Nazi gathering in Charlottesville, U.S., gave us all a disturbing insight into what can happen when ignorance, racism and Islamophobia join together with the intention of dividing our communities. It is critical that we do not become complacent in our rejection of racism and other forms of hate,\u201d said Nigel Barriffe, president of the Urban Alliance on Race Relations.\nThe Muslim council says it has recorded a \u201csignificant spike\u201d in the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes happening across the country \u2014 especially in the GTA.\nFull report at:\nhttps://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/08/09/anti-islam-group-postpones-rally-at-nathan-phillips-square.html\n--------\nElliott Broidy case: US judge calls for law to prosecute countries such as Qatar\n9 August 2018\nA US federal judge has called on Congress to legislate a law that allows prosecution of countries that carry out cybercrime targeting US citizens, saying that the absence of such laws makes it impossible to consider the case filed by Elliott Broidy against Qatar.\nThe judge refused formally to consider the case because of the lack of jurisdiction of the Court to hear cases in which one of the parties is a sovereign state enjoying immunity, according to Wall Street Journal.\nBut the judge stressed in his decision a paragraph indicating that there is a pressing need to legislate a law that allows the prosecution of states in view of the repetition of these incidents in recent years.\nHowever, the judge said they would continue to look into such violations committed by the individuals listed in the case.\nFull report at:\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2018/08/09/Elliott-Broidy-case-US-judge-calls-for-law-to-prosecute-countries-such-as-Qatar.html\n--------\nBrooklyn imam dismayed by family\u2019s tragedy at New Mexico compound\nAugust 10, 2018\nTAOS, N.M.: A prominent New York City Muslim cleric said on Thursday that he was baffled by events leading to his grandson\u2019s presumed death and the arrest of his son and four other adult relatives on charges of abusing children at a compound in New Mexico.\nSiraj WahHajj, a Brooklyn-based imam, spoke to reporters at his mosque, Masjid Taqwa, a day after his son, two daughters, a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law were charged with 11 felony counts of child abuse in New Mexico.\nThe son, Siraj Ibn WahHajj, 39, also was charged with custodial interference in the alleged abduction of his 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani WahHajj, last December from the Atlanta home of the child\u2019s mother.\nThe search for the missing boy and his father ultimately led investigators to the ramshackle compound on the outskirts of Amalia, New Mexico, north of Taos near the Colorado border.\nEleven children ranging from 1 to 15 years of age were found ragged and starving at the compound last Friday after sheriff\u2019s deputies raided it. They were placed in protective custody.\nThe imam, who was the first Muslim to offer a prayer before the US House of Representatives, said he is the biological grandfather of nine of the children in the case, including Abdul. Remains of a young boy believed to be those of Abdul were found at the compound on Monday.\nThe elder WahHajj said, without elaborating, that some of the children have said they saw Abdul alive as recently as three weeks ago, adding, \u201cOne of them said, \u2018Yeah, we buried him over there.\u2019\u201c\nHis son, said by authorities to have been heavily armed when arrested, was taken into custody with his brother-in-law, Lucas Morton. His wife Jany Leveille and two sisters, Subhannah and Hujrah WahHajj, were detained and later arrested.\nIn court petitions seeking to hold them without bond, prosecutors accused them of training the children to use firearms to carry out school shootings, but no related charges have been filed.\nThe elder Siraj WahHajj said he has been cooperating with authorities in their investigation and that he had not had direct communication with his son since a search for him was launched after Abdul\u2019s disappearance.\nHe said he did not know what his son and daughters were doing in New Mexico or what prompted them to go into seclusion, but he was anxious to get to the bottom of a situation he described as \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cweird.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as my son and my daughters are concerned, I want to make sure they get good legal representation. We want to find out what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s against them. We stand in judgment. God stands in judgment against them, and we stand on the side of truth.\u201d\nThe cleric recounted having a brief exchange with his daughter Subhannah at some point through a go-between on Facebook. Subhannah later reached out to someone in Atlanta saying, \u201c\u2019I need some food. We are starving.\u201d\nThe imam said he instructed that intermediary to \u201cfind out where we should send the food.\u201d He said once his daughter provided the location, \u201cWe gave it to the police.

The bill, moved by Pakistan Muslim League-Functional leader Nand Kumar was passed by the assembly in March, earlier this year, to give couples the right of \u2018separation\u2019 and allowing Hindu widows to remarry.\nThe bill not only accords the right of separation to both the husband and wife, but also ensures the financial security of the wife and children.\n\u201cEither party to Hindu marriage, whether solemnised before or after the commencement of this Act, may present a petition to the court praying for decree of judicial separation,\u201d the law states.\nThe law also places a general ban of underage marriages among members of the Hindu community. \u201cThe Hindu community had been protesting forced conversions and marriages of underage girls. This law has banned the marriage of minors from the Hindu community,\u201d said Nand Kumar, adding that he had also moved a bill against the forced conversions of members of religious minorities, but the bill was gathering dust in the Sindh Assembly secretariat.\nReferring to past practices, Kumar said Hindu women were considered lesser mortals, who were not even accorded the right to divorce before the enactment of this law. \u201cThe amendment to this law is aimed at getting rid of old and outdated customs,\u201d he remarked.\nPakistan Peoples Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto and other party leaders also felicitated the last provincial assembly\u2019s lawmakers on the passage of the act, which was ratified by the Governor last week.\nBefore the passage of this law, there was no legal cover for Hindu marriages for the past seven decades.\nhttps://tribune.com.pk/story/1777191/1-sindh-govt-notifies-hindu-marriage-law/\n--------\nPakistan stands with Saudia Arabia in diplomatic feud with Canada\nAUGUST 10, 2018\nDr Muhammad Faisal, Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson said, on Thursday, that Pakistan stands with Saudia Arabia in its diplomatic row with Canada.\nHe went on to say that \u201cPakistan always supports the sovereignty of states and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.

But he was later told by the temple society that his booking has been cancelled \u201cfor obvious reasons\u201d.\nAshitava Bhowmik, the president of the temple society, told IANS that Rahman\u2019s request could not be taken up for \u201cmore than one reason\u201d.\nHe alleged that Rahman \u201cconcealed his identity\u201d and made the booking in his daughter Ihini Ambreen\u2019s name \u201cwhich doesn\u2019t sound like Arabic or Muslim\u201d.\nBhowmik said \u201cwe got to know about his religious identity when a priest got suspicious and asked him about gotra\u201d -- the lineage which forms an important factor in determining Hindu ancestry.\n\u201cObviously, he had no answers. Muslims don\u2019t follow gotra system. His wife can no longer be considered a Hindu after marrying the Muslim because a woman adopts the surname and belief system of her in-laws and becomes a part of that society,\u201d Bhowmik told IANS.\nUnapologetically, he said, \u201cIt was done in keeping with and respecting the Hindu traditions and rites.\u201d\nAsked since it was the last wish of the woman, who followed the Hindu belief system, Bhowmik said \u201cwho knows the man has some ulterior motive and could bring in 50-100 of his relatives inside the temple and start praying Namaz\u201d there.\n\u201cWhat will we do in that case?

The woman can approach the magistrate to seek subsistence allowance for herself and her minor children, and can also seek custody of her minor children from the magistrate who will take a final call on the matter.\nThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017, introduced after the landmark 3-2 verdict of the Supreme Court which set aside the centuries-old practice of talaq-e-biddat or instant triple talaq in which Muslim men divorce their wives by uttering talaq three times in quick succession, has cleared Lok Sabha and is pending in Rajya Sabha where the government lacks numbers.\nThe government will bring the amendments to Rajya Sabha on Friday, the last day of the monsoon session.\nWhen the winter session of Parliament drew to a close in January this year, the fate of the Bill hung in the balance. The matter of ringfencing penal provisions in the Bill emerged as the central issue for some give-and-take to break the stalemate between the ruling BJP and the Opposition over the Bill.\nAfter the session concluded, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, offered to agree to the penal provisions in the Bill, provided it was insulated from outside interference and had a mechanism for subsistence allowance.\nAnnouncing the changes approved Thursday by the Cabinet, Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government did not want \u201canyone to misuse the law while ensuring that justice is done\u201d.\n\u201cThe Union Cabinet has approved amendments in the law relating to triple talaq. We have proposed three changes. FIR will become cognizable only if the complaint is filed by the victim, wife, blood relations, or relations by marriage. If any outside agency or neighbour is initiating this process, it will not be registered,\u201d Prasad told reporters.\n\u201cIt has been made compoundable, that is, if the wife and husband desire to settle differences, then the magistrate can compound the offence on appropriate terms and conditions. Magistrate can grant bail after hearing the wife,\u201d he said.\nThe minister rejected arguments that the husband cannot be sent to jail since he will not be able to provide subsistence to the divorced wife and children if he is in prison. \u201cIf a husband is convicted in a dowry case or domestic violence case also, he will go to jail. So why are such issues raised only in triple talaq? Congress should clarify if it is sticking to vote-bank politics,\u201d he said.\nMaintaining that the government did not make the changes under pressure from anyone, he said the decisions were taken in the interest of the people.\nTo Sonia Gandhi, Prasad said: \u201cYou are not just the Congress leader, you are a national leader too. You keep talking about the legacy of your family\u2026 Would you stand for justice, honour and respect for women? Or would you continue to oppose the Bill?\u201d.

The recovery of the arms and ammunition leading to the arrest of the two suspects is part of our vigit, the officer said.\n''The Special Cell has launched a drive against supply of illegal firearms in Delhi from other parts of the country. Concerted efforts have led to busting of several gun selling rackets and seizure of huge cache of sophisticated/semi-automatic weapons,'' the officer said.\nAccording to the DCP, the teams of the Special Cell have successfully busted two interstate gun-selling rackets with the recovery of large cache of arms and ammunition from the accused.\nAzim was arrested by one of the teams of the Special Cell on August 6 following a tip-off, he said.\nAzim along with Akil had come to deliver the huge consignment of illegal firearms to Hazi Kayum in Delhi. Following specific inputs, a team laid a trap at the vantage points near Tara Chowk, Dheerpur in northwest Delhi here, the officer said.\nAround 11.55 am, Azim was found waiting for Kayum, carrying two trolley bags. He was subsequently overpowered and nabbed. From the trolley bags two automatic sophisticated carbines, 38 pistols and 50 live cartridges concealed in clothes and newspapers were recovered, the ACP said.\nAnother team of the Special Cell nabbed Soyyam, a key member of arms supplier syndicate of Kairana (UP) from near CNG station in village Singhola near GT Karnal road, added the DCP.\nTwelve sophisticated .32 bore pistols and 19 magazines were recovered from his bag, the DCP said.\nDuring interrogation, it came to light that after the police crackdown in Bihar's Munger, the arms manufacturers have shifted their base to West Bengal and weapons are being manufactured at different places.\nThe weapons manufactured in West Bengal are being supplied in Delhi and its neighbouring areas.\nThe DCP said raids are being conducted to nab more associates of the arrested duo.\nIn a related incident, the Army too seized a large quantity of arms and explosive materials, including 7 firearms, 14 grenades and 401 rounds, during a search operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district on Thursday.\nArmy troops discovered the weapons during a search operation in the Chapriyan-KP Nala area of Mandi tehsil, a defence spokesperson said.\nThe recoveries include four 9mm pistols with seven magazines and 31 rounds, four carrying bags, one AK-56 rifle (with sling) along with three loaded magazines, one 7.62mm rifle of foreign origin, one revolver, 14 hand grenades and one AK-47 Bayonet, he added.\nMeanwhile, the National Investigating Agency (NIA) has arrested a suspected member of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh in Bengaluru.\nThe arrest was made a day after the NIA nabbed the outfit's top leader Mohammed Jahidul Islam, wanted in several terror cases.\n29-year old Adil Alias Assadullah, a resident of a village in West Bengal's Murshidabad district, was arrested near the Cantonment Railway station on August 7 in connection with the bomb blast at Kalchakra Maidan in Bodh Gaya on January 19, the NIA said in a statement.\nHe is believed to be the close associate of Jahidul Islam, who was arrested by an NIA team from nearby Ramanagara.\nFull report at:\nhttp://zeenews.india.com/india/ahead-of-independence-day-explosives-seized-in-delhi-terror-suspects-nabbed-in-bengaluru-2131919.html\n--------\nModi Govt Waters Down Triple Talaq Bill With Bail Clause to Clear Rajya Sabha Hurdle\nAugust 9, 2018\nNew Delhi: The Muslim Women Protection of Rights Bill 2018, colloquially known as the Triple Talaq Bill, will now have a clause that would ensure Muslim husbands have a right to approach the court seeking bail after being arrested on charges of instantaneous talaq.\nDuring the last Budget Session of the Parliament, when the bill was tabled in Lok Sabha, there was a strong demand to refer the bill to a parliamentary select committee. However, with a sizeable strength in the lower house, the government had managed to pass the bill.\nThe bill got stalled in the Rajya Sabha amid protests by the opposition. The provision of bail was one of the biggest sticking points. In the tweaked version passed by the Union Cabinet, the offence would stay non-bailable but a judge can decide whether to grant bail after hearing out the wife.\nGiving instant triple talaq would still continue to be illegal and void and will attract a jail term of three years for the husband. But the case can be dropped if both sides agree, the new version of the bill says.\nThe proposed law would only be applicable on instant triple talaq or 'talaq-e-biddat' and it would give power to the victim to approach a magistrate seeking \"subsistence allowance\" for herself and minor children.\nHowever, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board is still not impressed with the changes.\nBoard member and legal counsel, Zafaryab Jilani, told News18 that there were several other amendments that were demanded to be brought in and this amendment did not \"portray the true picture.\"\n\"Let the bill be introduced in the Rajya Sabha. The bill is void in totality and hence objections will remain but there were other specific objections made too that have remained unanswered in the latest cabinet meeting,\" said Jilani.\nZakia Soman, convener of Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, who was one of the key petitioners in the case, told News18 that though this amendment was a welcome change, but \"there still exists others that is needed.\"\n\"Yes the bail amendment is welcome but the provision which makes FIR registered by anyone acceptable needs to be amended and it has to be only at the behest of wife. There also needs to be a provision which states that a wife will have a right over her matrimonial residence even though the husband is penalised,\" said Soman.\nUnion Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who had tabled the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, called it a \u201chistoric day.\u201d\nSaying that the bill should not be seen through the prism of vote-bank, but from the humanitarian side, Prasad said the bill was \u201cnot about religion but about justice and respect for women.\u201d He said that the bill was essential for gender equality and dignity.\nAccording to the bill, a woman can also seek the custody of her minor children from the magistrate who will take a final call on the issue.\nThe bill was passed in Lok Sabha after the House rejected a string of amendments moved by various opposition members. MPs from the RJD, AIMIM, BJD, AIADMK and All India Muslim League had opposed the bill, calling it arbitrary in nature and a faulty proposal.\nOwaisi was the strongest critic of the bill and had said that \"dowry deaths and other crimes against women did not stop even when specific laws were made against these practices.\"\nFull report at:\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/india/cabinet-approves-provision-of-bail-in-triple-talaq-bill-1839311.html\n--------\nIntel input says Masood Azhar\u2019s nephew in India, agencies on high alert\nAugust 10, 2018\nAhead of Independence Day celebrations, security agencies are on their toes after an intelligence input was received that the nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and his younger brother Abdul Rauf\u2019s former bodyguard have infiltrated into India and are suspected to have set up terror modules in Delhi and Srinagar.\nAccording to the input, accessed by The Indian Express, Mohammed Umer, son of Azhar\u2019s elder brother Ibrahim, infiltrated into Jammu and Kashmir in the last week of May. In the same month, Rauf\u2019s former bodyguard Mohammed Ismail is also learnt to have entered Kashmir. Rauf is a key accused in the IC 814 hijacking which led to Azhar\u2019s release from captivity in India.\nWorryingly, Ismail was learnt to have visited Delhi immediately after infiltrating into Kashmir and is now back into the Valley after, perhaps, setting up a module. \u201cMohammed Ismail has also entered J&K in May 2018. However, he moved towards Delhi, where he was asked to set up a module for a spectacular operation,\u201d the input said.\nConfirming his current location in J&K, it said, \u201cAs per latest input, senior formations of JeM based in Pakistan have now located Mohammed Ismail in the general area between Pulwama and Srinagar.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Azhar\u2019s nephew Mohammed Umer is learnt to be working on recruiting and training youths in J&K, which has recently seen a surge in young men joining militant ranks. According to the input, Umer has been \u201ctasked to oversee operational preparation and training of newly recruited Kashmiri youth inside the Valley by staying for a period of six months\u201d.\nSecurity agencies, in fact, have already had an encounter with Umer in which he escaped and later took shelter near Pantha Chowk in Srinagar, according to the input. Last month, a group associated with Umer had even snatched weapons from policemen in Kashmir, the input said.\nIntelligence agencies have learnt that Mohammed Ismail is currently with Umer to execute the outfit\u2019s plans in Kashmir.\n\u201cThe presence of two extremely important and senior JeM Commanders in the Valley closer to the Independence Day Celebrations and the ongoing Amarnath Yatra has significant security implications,\u201d the input said.\nFollowing the input, security forces across the country, particularly in J&K and Delhi, have been asked to remain extra alert and watchful. All military and central armed police camps in J&K have been asked to maintain tight security around their camps and to be extremely vigilant. Suggestions have also been made to increase the number of pickets and have more road opening exercises in Kashmir, Home Ministry sources said.\nFull report at:\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/intel-input-says-jaish-e-mohammed-chief-masood-azhars-nephew-in-india-agencies-on-high-alert-5299880/\n--------\nEurope\nOne third of Britons view Johnson\u2019s burqa comments as racist: Poll\nAug 9, 2018\nA new poll shows that more than a third of people in Britain view comments by former foreign minister Boris Johnson on burqa, a full-body dress for Muslim women, as racist.\nAccording to the results of the survey by Sky News, six out of ten people said it was \"not\" racist to compare Muslim women wearing the Islamic veils to \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletter boxes \u201d as Johnson had designated, while just 33 percent of the respondents thought it was racist.\nThe poll also suggested that 26 percent of Britons were against a ban on burqas, while around 60 percent supported such a ban by the government.\nThe poll was conducted after Johnson made the comparisons in an article for The Daily Telegraph newspaper on Monday.\nIt revealed that Britons remain split as to whether Johnson should apologize for his remarks - 45 percent think he should do so, while the majority, some 48 percent, think he should not.\nPeople from the capital city London were the heaviest critics of Johnson, a man they twice elected as London mayor, with over 50 percent saying he should apologize for the Islamophobic remarks.\nA series of prominent Conservatives have called on Johnson to apologize, including the Prime Minister Theresa May.

A second batch of US sanctions will be re-imposed on Iran in November with the aim of undermining its oil exports and shipping sectors.\nThe US president has also threatened punitive measures against the firms that refuse to stop their business links with Iran when the American sanctions return.\nWashington's move drew criticisms from Russia, China and the European parties to the Iran deal -- France, Britain and Germany.\nThe EU was quick to issue a statement in defense of the landmark accord, vowing to fight the American sanctions and protect the firms working with Iran.\nThe 28-nation bloc has activated a \"blocking statute\" aimed to mitigate the impact of American restrictive measures on European firms legally active in the Iranian market.

It replaced an earlier one that, in turn, had been built to replace Weizhou\u2019s 600-year-old Chinese-style mosque, which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution along with thousands of other temples, churches and monasteries across the country.\nThe government\u2019s order sparked an outcry in the Hui Muslim community, with many people questioning why the authorities did not stop construction of the mosque \u2013 which took two years to complete \u2013 if it had not been granted the necessary paperwork.\nVideo footage seen by the Post showed police vehicles parked in the square, while on the mosque more than 10 Chinese national flags fluttered in the wind.\nTwo red banners had also been strung from the mosque\u2019s exterior walls, one of which read: \u201cResolutely support the Chinese Communist Party, defend ethnic unity, safeguard the freedom of faith\u201d.\nDespite the large numbers of people involved, the demonstration appeared to be peaceful, and the Post had not received any reports of violence as of Thursday evening.\nThe Weizhou resident said that many Hui believed it was not the intention of the Party\u2019s central leadership to tear down their mosque.\n\u201cThe local government is not implementing the central government\u2019s policies,\u201d he said.\nStill, the Weizhou government\u2019s move was most likely a response to the Communist Party\u2019s call to \u201cSinicise religion\u201d \u2013 a policy introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2015 and intended to bring religious groups in line with Chinese culture and the absolute authority of the party.\nA visit to Ningxia by a Post reporter in April found that Islamic icons and Arabic signs had been removed from streets in towns and counties across the region. While secular buildings appeared to have been the first targets, at least two mosques had their domes removed earlier this year.\nFor decades, China\u2019s Hui Muslims have been largely left in peace to practise their faith. Most of them speak Mandarin, and apart from the white caps and headscarves worn by the more traditional members of the ethnic group they are indistinguishable from the majority Han population.\nBut as the government deepens its crackdown on Uygurs \u2013 another mostly Muslim group in the western frontier of Xinjiang \u2013 the Hui are also being targeted.\nSeveral mosques in Nigxia have been ordered to cancel public Arabic classes, while a number of private Arabic schools have been told to shut down.\nIn 2012, hundreds of Hui clashed with police in Tongxin as they tried to stop their mosque from being demolished after it was declared illegal. Several protesters were reportedly killed in the violence and dozens more were injured.\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2159047/chinese-hui-muslims-rally-protect-weizhou-grand-mosque\n--------\n\u2018Brave\u2019 Mujahid defended Islam by removing LGBT portraits, Perak Mufti says\n10 August 2018\nIPOH, Aug 10 \u2014 Perak mufti Tan Sri Harussani Zakaria has praised Datuk Mujahid Yusof Rawa for ordering the removal of the portraits of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists from the George Town Festival.\nIn a statement issued today, Harussani commended the minister in the prime minister\u2019s department in charge of religious affairs and that he fully supported the move.\n\u201cCongratulations and well done to the Menteri Agama(Minister who oversees Islamic Affairs) for being brave enough to state the truth, and indirectly defend the credibility of the Islamic institution,\u201d Harussani said.\n\u201cLGBT is an act which is mungkar (defying God\u2019s laws) and it has been forbidden by Allah whether it is done openly or privately.\u201d\n\u201cLGBT is also a condemnable act which contravenes the rights of a person, because it denies the rights of a relationship through a marriage that is legal and recognised by Islamic law.\u201d\nHarussani also said the act of promoting LGBT icons in public was an effort to encourage and recognise the \u2018forbidden\u2019 act.\nEarlier this week, Mujahid admitted that he had ordered the removal of portraits depicting transgender activist Nisha Ayub and gay rights advocate Pang Khee Teik at the festival.\nHe said the portraits were \u201cpromoting LGBT activities\u201d, adding that it was not in line with Pakatan Harapan\u2019s policies.\nNisha is a transgender activist who has won many awards for her work including the US Secretary of State\u2019s International Women of Courage Award in 2016 while Pang is the co-founder of Seksualiti Merdeka \u2015 an annual human rights festival.\nFull report at:\nhttps://www.malaymail.com/s/1661096/brave-mujahid-defended-islam-by-removing-lgbt-portraits-perak-mufti-says\n--------\nOkay to task 2 groups to reform Islamic bodies, says don\nVinodh Pillai and Nur Hasliza Mohd Salleh\nAugust 9, 2018\nKUALA LUMPUR: A constitutional law expert says there should be no issue over duplication of roles between Putrajaya\u2019s top advisory council and a similar council announced by the Malay rulers recently.

Let the government decide and examine the constitutionality of their recommendations,\u201d he said after meeting the CEP at Ilham Tower today.\nShad noted the process would be a long-drawn one, as the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers would first have to take into account the legal considerations of both councils\u2019 recommendations.\nThen, it would have to be debated in both houses of Parliament.\nThe Conference of Rulers recently agreed to the formation of a new special committee for improving federal Islamic institutions in Malaysia, called the High-level Committee on Federal Institutions of Islamic Affairs.\nThis came on the back of another committee formed under the purview of the five-member CEP previously, where several prominent Islamic scholars and activists were similarly tasked with drafting a proposal on Islamic reforms.\nA source told FMT that a possible clash could take place between the two groups in the near future, as one side or the other might not easily give way over the suggestions.\nMoreover, one committee is seen as more powerful than the other as it is directly under the rulers.\nShad said there was a need for the true spirit of Islam, shariah and civil laws to be enumerated in the new Malaysia, as well as the special position of the Federal Constitution.\n\u201cThis country was built on compromises and compassion. It\u2019s time to walk the middle path of tolerance.\u201d\nOver the years, leaders had questioned state Islamic authorities, especially the Malaysian Department of Islamic Affairs (Jakim), over what was perceived as their penchant for imposing a more rigid form of Islam in the country.\nThese influential government religious officers had also been blamed for a spate of controversial religious rulings as well as the banning of hundreds of books over the years dealing with Islam.\nJakim had also come under the microscope, with leaders from both sides of the political divide calling for it to be dismantled, saying its powers were against the constitutional provision that matters of Islam came under the purview of state rulers.\nProminent novelist Faisal Tehrani agreed with Shad that there was a need for an advisory council to regulate Islamic affairs, whether it was under the rulers or Parliament.\nHowever, the award-winning author, who has seven of his books banned in Malaysia, said there had to be a diverse mix of advisers in the councils, including historians, sociologists, scientists and Islamic experts.\nFull report at:\nhttp://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/08/09/kay-to-task-2-groups-to-reform-islamic-bodies-says-don/\n--------\nIndonesia launches new group to combat extremism\nAugust 3, 2018\nModerate Muslims in Indonesia have launched a new civil society group to promote interreligious tolerance in a country where religious and ethnic sentiments are on the rise ahead of a presidential election in 2019.\nMore than 200 people, including religious leaders such as Jakarta's Catholic archbishop, as well as politicians, attended the Aug. 1 launch of the Said Aqil Siroj Institute in Jakarta.\nThe new non-profit organization is named after a prominent Muslim cleric who now serves as chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesia's largest Islamic organization.\n\"His thoughts and ideas highlighting tolerance, mutual respect, peace and willingness to work together with people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds have inspired the establishment of this institute.

It becomes a healthier version of religion,\u201d he said outside Ilham Tower today.\nSeven out of his 45 books have been banned in Malaysia by the previous administration over allegations that they contained elements of Shia Islam, a school of thought labelled as \u201cdeviant\u201d by Malaysia\u2019s Islamic authorities.\nThe seven books are \u201cSebongkah Batu di Kuala Berang\u201d, \u201cKarbala\u201d, \u201cTiga Kali Seminggu\u201d, \u201cIngin Jadi Nasrallah\u201d, \u201cPerempuan Nan Bercinta\u201d, \u201cSinema Spiritual: Dramaturgi dan Kritikan:\u201d, and \u201cAKU___, MAKA AKU ADA!\u201d\nThe home ministry told FMT in June that the bans had yet to be lifted.\nFaisal said Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad had already said his government hoped to push for a better version of Islam, \u201cone that does not punish people as it currently does.\u201d\n\u201cWhen a fatwa is issued in this country, it is also lawful.

Many countries try to avoid it as much as it can to save its people from its tragic consequences and preserve their homes from devastation and destruction, along with spectre of thousands of dead, wounded, disabled and homeless.\nHowever, Ali Reza Farqani, Iranian editor-in-chief of Arman newspaper, says his country \u201cneeds a foreign war,\u201d threatening Washington that pro-Iranian suicide bombers would hit US bases in 112 countries in any possible war.\nThe author repeated a slogan by the founder of the Iranian regime, Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980s, when he said that \"war is a blessing\" in reference to the war between Iraq and Iran, which ended after Tehran was forced to accept the UN resolution calling for a cease-fire between the two countries.\nAt that time, Khomeini said that he had to submit to the resolution saying: \"I drink the cup of poison.\"\nAfter US President Donald Trump ordered US sanctions against Iran to take effect last Tuesday, with will be further escalated to a more severe level on November 4, Ali Reza Farqani, an Iranian media editor and editor-in-chief \u2018Arman Press', has written an article in which he expressed \u201cthe readiness of the Iranians to fight the war against the United States of America.\u201d\nThe Washington Post reported at the end of last April that the Pentagon is working on a plan to counter Iran\u2019s expansion and destabilizing the Middle East through Tehran\u2019s support for armed groups in the region.\n\u201cThe US military will not face Iran directly, but it will use indirect means to limit its expansion in Syria and Iraq,\u201d General Joseph Leonard Votel, who heads the US Central Command, was quoted as saying.\nReady for war against the US\n\u201cWe are ready to wage a major war against the United States,\u201d Farqani said in his article. The writer described the war as \u201cjihadist security.\u201d\nThe editor-in-chief of Arman Press believes that the call for war by Iran would \u201cchange the perception of the military and American and Israeli politicians toward the Iranians, and help to stop the talk about the military option.\u201d\nThe author attempted to interpret and interpret Iran\u2019s call for foreign war as being based on the origin of jihad, claiming that such a war would be between two intellectual models. The first represented theism and the second was humanism.\nAfter describing the details of the differences between the two trends, the hardline Iranian media person issued threats against American officials and warned them: \u201cYou have to understand that the next war will ensure the survival of the Islamic Revolution of Iran and eliminate America completely and it will be a war of solidarity for all Iranian Muslims.\u201d\n\u201cThe Iranian dictionary does not include the word dictionary \u2018defeat',\u201d he claimed.\nThe writer then tried to justify his call for war with America by resorting to the interpretation of Quranic verses on his own, describing the Iranian side as the holy party in this war and the other side in the Holy Land, claiming that Iran is the \u201cfront of truth\u201d in such a war.\nAfter a lengthy comparison between the Iranian and American soldier\u2019s preferences and the preference of the Iranian soldier for the other soldiers of the Muslim countries, he addressed the Americans, threatening them with suicide operations in different countries, saying: \u201cAmerica should know that if it entered into a war with Iran, the Hezbollah youth will determine the area of the battlefield far from Iran\u2019s borders and within a period of less than 48 hours will launch suicide attacks.\nThreat to rape Obama\u2019s daughter\nAli Reza Farqani was one of the former prime ministers of the government of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and former ruler of Kish Island in the Gulf, where he left office after disagreements with Ahmadinejad\u2019s government. He is a member of the hardline Islamic movement in Iran and had threatened in his blog to rape the daughter of former US President Obama if Syria was attacked by the United States.\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cweak points\u201d, which he considered an easy prey for all the \u201cpeoples of the world\u201d, were to threaten to kidnap a member of the family of every minister, ambassador and military commander around the world within one day, he said.\nAli Reza Farqani is a member of the \u201cAmmarioun\u201d headquarters of the radical Iranian pro-Iranian leader and reflects the views of the most extreme spectra in Iran.\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2018/08/10/Iran-We-will-hit-112-US-bases-with-suicide-bombings.html\n--------\nHamas, Israel agree Egypt-mediated truce to end Gaza flare-up: Officials\nAug 9, 2018\nPalestinian officials have confirmed that the resistance movement Hamas and the Israeli regime have agreed on a ceasefire mediated by Egypt to stop cross-border fire in the Gaza Strip.\nA Palestinian official with knowledge of the ceasefire talks", "url": "http://www.newageislam.com/islamic-world-news/new-age-islam-news-bureau/canadian-pm-refuses-to-withdraw-criticism-of-saudi-human-rights-record/d/116096", "label": 1}
