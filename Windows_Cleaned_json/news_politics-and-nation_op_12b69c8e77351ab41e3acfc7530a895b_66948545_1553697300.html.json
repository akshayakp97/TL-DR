Small parties are making a beeline for the DMK-Congress alliance after having lost in the previous parliamentary polls contesting without any Dravidian party in alliance, he said.The Mekedatu reservoir plan arrives at a time when slow relief efforts in the aftermath of the Gaja cyclone have turned into a tool for the Opposition to take on the ruling AIADMK in the state.A controversy since 2013, the Mekedatu reservoir issue flared up again after a recent Central Water Commission approval to Karnataka\u2019s feasibility report, and permission to draft a detailed project report.The Tamil Nadu government has moved the Supreme Court seeking withdrawal of the permission and directions to Karnataka to maintain status quo on the project.Even as the AIADMK sends out statements to reassure Cauvery Delta farmers in the aftermath of the Gaja cyclone, the DMK organised a protest in Trichy to condemn the Centre for granting the permission.The DMK\u2019s unveiling of a statue of late leader M Karunanidhi on December 16 is considered as another platform for Opposition unity. With Congress leader Sonia Gandhi expected to attend the ceremony, the event is likely to fortify the existing DMK-Congress coalition and expand the alliance\u2019s base to other parties.\u201cWe have invited only state chief ministers, and, of course, Sonia Gandhi,\u201d said a DMK leader on the conditions of anonymity.Besides the general elections, Tamil Nadu is also slated for by-polls in 18 constituencies that became vacant after lawmakers with TTV Dhinakaran lost their legal battle against the speaker\u2019s decision to disqualify them for \u201cvoluntarily giving up their membership\u201d of the AIADMK.The Election Commission had sought details of legal encumbrances to holding by-polls.The state elections department had responded that there have been no appeals challenging the recent Madras High Court order upholding the disqualification of the MLAs, said an official with the department.", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/opposition-unity-on-display-in-tamil-nadu-anti-mekedatu-protests/articleshow/66948545.cms", "label": 1}
