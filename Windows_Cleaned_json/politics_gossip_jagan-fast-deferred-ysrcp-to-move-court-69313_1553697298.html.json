We have full faith in judiciary and the fast will be taken up once we get a clearance from the court. Till such a date, the indefinite fast stands postponed,\" he said.\nDenying permission to the indefinite fast is an act of irresponsibility as people have the right to express their dissent and TDP has been cold-shouldering the special status issue and the central aid which was announced yesterday is a pittance he said.", "url": "https://www.greatandhra.com/politics/gossip/jagan-fast-deferred-ysrcp-to-move-court-69313", "label": 1}
