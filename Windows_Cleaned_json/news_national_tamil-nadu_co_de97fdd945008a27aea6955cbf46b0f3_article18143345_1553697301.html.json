Subbaraju, vice-president, All India Federation of University and College Teachers\u2019 Organisations (AIFUCTO), the teaching fraternity across the country observed Wednesday (April 19) as \u2018Demands Day\u2019 by wearing badges, urging the Central government and the Ministry of Human Resources Development to immediately publish the report of the UGC\u2019s Seventh Pay Review Committee and share the report with the AIFUCTO.\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the AIFUCTO held at Periyar University, Salem, on March 19 expressed its displeasure over the \u201cundemocratic and apathetic attitude\u201d of the Central government and decided to observe April 19 as \u2018Demands Day\u2019 with members wearing badges, carrying their demand.\nIn the past, the UGC and the Ministry had made public the UGC\u2019s Pay Review Committee reports and allowed discussions not only on pay- related recommendations but also on issues such as enhancing quality of higher education, retaining talents in teaching profession, etc.\n\u201cHowever, this time, the MHRD is keeping the PRC report a secret, avoiding any meaningful discussion on the issues pertaining to higher education. This is unprecedented and undemocratic,\u201d Prof. Subbaraju said.\nIn the first week of April, the associations affiliated to the AIFUCTO sent letters to the MHRD and the UGC, urging them to publish the UGC\u2019s Seventh Pay Review Committee report. In Tamil Nadu, the major constituents of the AIFUCTO and several faculty associations of State universities participated in this campaign.\n\u201cIf the indifferent attitude of the MHRD persists, the AIFUCTO will be forced to resort to all sorts of democratic struggles,\u201d Prof. Subbaraju added.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/college-teachers-protest-undemocratic-attitude-of-the-centre-tirunelveli/article18143345.ece", "label": 1}
