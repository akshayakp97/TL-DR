Can the government buy or sell any other land without the approval of its owner? In the 2013 version of the Land Acquisition Act, a few allowances were made for farmers but now even these are being removed,\u201d said Yadav.\nHe added that the BJP had been unable to get the green signal from the party\u2019s own farmers\u2019 union but were proceeding with the controversial ordinance in the name of development.\nBKU president Naresh Tikait said farmers do not want to obstruct development but protests would continue unless the Centre meets them and accedes to their demands.\n\u201cThese amendments in the Land Acquisition Bill were introduced without any discussions with farmers. Our basic demand is that farmers\u2019 assent is a must and fertile land should not be acquired for private or even public-private projects,\u201d he said.\nYadav also asserted that urea shortages in the country this year had been artificially created and meant to take advantage of farmers.\n\u201cIt was created only to decontrol the sector. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s no respect for farmers in the country any longer so the only way to retaliate is through demonstrations like these,\u201d he said.\nHe was addressing a packed assembly that had farmers from all over the country, a sizeable number of whom had made the trip to the Capital from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\nPolitical parties are simultaneously taking to streets in different States. In Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar sat on a day-long fast last Saturday to register his protest against the proposed Bill while his colleague, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, led a march in Patna the very next day. DMK chief M Karunanidhi too has announced that his party will organise a protest in Tiruvarur, Tamil Nadu, later this week.\nA Joint Forum against the Land Acquisition Bill 2015, which includes farmers\u2019 wings of the communist parties and activist groups, has called for observing March 23, the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh, Sukh Dev and Raj Guru, as Land Rights Day.\nThe All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) of the CPI will organise district or block-level functions across the country.\n\u201cThe AIKS has called upon the peasantry to prepare for an intensive and protracted struggle to defeat the nefarious design of the NDA government to steal the hard won right of the peasants on land,\u201d said RC Yadav on behalf of the AIKS.", "url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/farmers-take-to-streets-to-protest-land-bill/article7007973.ece", "label": 1}
