Shivpal had a bad break-up with SP after his brother Mulayam Singh Yadav and nephew Akhilesh sidelined him from the party\u2019s ranks. It is, however, still not known whether Mulayam will attend the rally today.\n\u201cThe rally today will act as a launchpad for the PSP (L) in the political spectrum, an alternative to the people of Uttar Pradesh ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019,\u201d party spokesperson Deepak Misra said yesterday.\nMisra claimed that at least 2 lakh supporters of PSP(L) are expected to be present at the rally, where the numbers come from UP as well as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.\nMeanwhile, the raging debate on the caste of Lord Hanuman reached new heights of hilarity with PSP(L) demanding a caste certificate for the Hindu deity. Shivpal\u2019s party even threatened a sit-in if the district administration failed to provide one within a week.\n\u201cWe have applied for the caste certificate of Lord Hanuman at the office of the Varanasi district magistrate. As the CM has termed him as a Dalit and dragged the deity in petty caste politics, we want his caste certificate,\u201d news agency PTI quoted Yadav as saying.", "url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/mulayam-singh-yadav-s-brother-shivpal-to-hold-massive-pspl-rally-lucknow/328247", "label": 1}
