We will decide steps to take. We will leave no stone unturned in the interest of people of Odisha,\u201d he said.\nAdvertising\nEarlier, Bharti said the decision to form the committee was taken \u201camicably\u201d.\n\u201cA committee will be formed under officer on special duty to examine all the projects of Chhattisagarh and Odisha which are eligible to be first studied by technical advisory committee (TAC), but are being built without TAC\u2019s go ahead\n\u201cThe committee under OSD will study data from the two states within a week to see if rules were flouted while constructing the projects,\u201d Bharti told reporters.\nThe committee, which will also have officials from the two states as their members, will study the projects within a week. Two teams will be sent to the two states to gather data.\nThe Union Minister said another committee will be formed, as proposed by Odisha government, to study situation in Mahanadi basin/catchment area during monsoon and non-monsoon period.\n\u201cIf the committee says, a board will be set up to settle disputes. The committee will be headed by Water Resources Ministry official and will have officials from both states, Water Resources Ministry officials and environmentalists as its members,\u201d she added.\nWatch What Else Is Making News\nPatnaik claimed that the barrages being constructed by Chhattisgarh government on Mahanadi will affect drinking water and irrigation facilities in Odisha, a concern which was downplayed by Singh.\nAmong other things, Bharti said Chhattisgarh proposed setting up of a gauge station by Central Water Commission at a point where Mahanadi enters Odisha to know amount of water flows to latter. \u201cOdisha has backed the proposal,\u201d she added.\nTo resolve the dispute, the Union Water Resources Minister proposed that both Odisha and Chhattisgarh stop work for a week on projects which have become a bone of contention between the two states.\nAsked whether the states agreed to this, she said, \u201cwe can only propose\u201d as water is a state subject.\nTerming Mahanadi as \u201clifeline\u201d for Odisha, Patnaik said Chhattisgarh\u2019s barrages on Mahanadi will \u201cseriously\u201d affect supply of drinking water and irrigation activities in Odisha besides creating environmental issues in its sanctuaries.\n\u201cI raised the point strongly and said the Chhattisgarh government must stop work on their barrages on Mahanadi river. At least, stop work for sometime, sit down and look into these matters. But they were not agreeable. I have called a meeting of the Cabinet in Bhubaneswar tomorrow. We will decide steps to take. We will leave no stone unturned in the interest of people of Odisha,\u201d he said.\nAsked if the meeting did not yield any solution for Odisha, Patnaik said, \u201cI said (it) quite clearly.\u201d\nSingh downplayed concerns raised by Patnaik saying the quantum of water which flows from Chhattisgarh to Odisha\u2019s Hirakud Dam can fill the reservoir \u201cfive times\u201d and said the neighbouring state\u2019s objection as \u201csurprising\u201d.\nWhen asked about Patnaik\u2019s decision to call state cabinet\u2019s meeting to decide further steps in the matter, Bharti said, \u201cIt is the state\u2019s right to take steps it wants. We have no right to advise any state on it.\u201d\nShe added that the Central Water Commission (CWC) has not received any master plan from Chhattisgarh for any project on Mahanadi.\nSpeaking about issues raised by Patnaik during the two-and-half hour meeting, Singh said the six barrages, construction of which is being questioned by Odisha, are complete to the extent of 99 percent and don\u2019t require permission of CWC. He sought to quiz timing of the neighbouring state\u2019s objection.\nHe also blamed Odisha for not being ready to form a board to settle inter-state disputes over use of Mahanadi.\nAdvertising\n\u201cChhattisgarh is using only 15 percent of the river water. 35 percent is used by Odisha. Rest is flowing into the sea. You use this downstream water going into sea,\u201d Singh advised Odisha government.", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/mahanadi-row-centre-tries-to-resolve-issue-but-odisha-cm-naveen-patnaik-unhappy-3036152/", "label": 1}
