It is not a new group. We condemn the decision to ban it. Even if you think they did something wrong, they should have been given a fair hearing. This is just one visible instance of the administration\u2019s autocratic behaviour. This issue is not limited to IIT Madras alone. Across IITs, there are various problems, such as poor implementation of the reservation systems, absence of Dalit faculty and so on. What does it mean when they say IITs are not political? Everything is political. To be political is my right,\u201d Kranthi Kumar, a Ph.D. scholar from IIT Bombay told The Hindu.\nIn response to the ban, students from IIT Bombay have formed an Ambedkar-Periyar-Phule Study Circle, which staged its first protest on campus on Sunday.\n\u201cEven though we stood silently with posters, the IIT security personnel, administration and the police threatened us with adverse action. We were told to remove the mention of the HRD Ministry from our posters. So the message is \u2018don\u2019t say anything against the government\u2019. It is very important for students across campuses to come together,\u201d Paanki Agrawal from IIT Bombay said.\nProtesters chanted the slogans such as, \u2018when will achche din come?\u2019, \u2018long live Ambedkar and Periyar\u2019, \u2018down with casteism\u2019 and demanded a revocation of the ban.\n\u201cWe express our solidarity with the study circle and with the aim of annihilation of the caste system. Silencing of voices is a dangerous step,\u201d said Bodhayan Roy from the Marxist study circle at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.\n\u201cSuch bans,\u201d pointed out Sunija M.V. from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), \u201cwill obstruct the support system of marginalised students on campuses. As a result you will see more student suicides.\u201d\nStudents also questioned the irony of demonising the ideas of Dr. Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution.\n\u201cAre we living in dualism?\u201d asked Jackson Khumukcham from TISS. \u201cIt is time to think about the kind of education we want to impart. \u201d he said.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/iitm-ban-protests-spread-to-mumbai/article7272310.ece", "label": 1}
