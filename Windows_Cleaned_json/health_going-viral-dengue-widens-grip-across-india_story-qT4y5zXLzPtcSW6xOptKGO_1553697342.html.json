Yet the government\u2019s awareness campaigns and messaging remains outdated, so people don\u2019t use protection,\u201d said Dr Aggarwal.\nGoing viral\nDengue is a viral infection that causes severe joint pain, nausea, abdominal cramps, fever lasting several days, and in some cases, bleeding from the gums, nose or ears, and rashes. It has no cure but most people recover with symptomatic treatment for fever and pain.\nIn severe cases, people develop haemorrhagic fever, which may cause death from shock and multi-organ failure.\nBefore 1970, only nine countries experienced severe dengue outbreaks but by 2016, it spread across the tropics, putting more than 3.5 billion people are at risk of infection. Around 390 million people in more than 100 countries get infected with dengue each year, estimates the World Health Organisation.\nOver the past 50 years, variations in rainfall, temperature and relative humidity, rapid urbanisation, rising population, increased travel and poor vector-control in urban areas have increased the infection 30-fold.\n\u201cThe Aedes aegypti mosquito is a \u2018synanthropic\u2019 species \u2013 much like house flies and cockroaches -- that benefit from artificial habitats created where people live,\u201d said Dr Veena Valecha, director, India\u2019s National Institute of Malaria Research. Since Aedes aegypti breeds in fresh water collected in hard surfaces, such as containers and pots, it is found in and around homes.\n\u201cThis partly explains why more cases are reported from densely populated urban areas unlike malaria, which causes disease near fields and forests, too, because the anopheles mosquito breeds in freshwater ponds as well,\u201d said Dr Valecha.\nEarly management of symptoms prevents complications. Among states with recorded deaths, Karnataka has more than 13,200 cases and five deaths, which makes the death rate a low 0.037%. Uttar Pradesh has India\u2019s highest death rate of 1.26%, with 1,903 cases and 24 deaths.\n\u201cOf the four dengue serotypes, DEN-2 and DEN-4 are more virulent and cause severe disease. This year, DEN-3 is causing infection in India, which leads to fewer hospitalisations,\u201d said Dr Aggarwal.\nSince DEN-3 was also the dominant strain last year, many people developed \u201cherd immunity\u201d against it and fewer people needed hospitalisation.\n\u201cAfter recovery, cross immunity to the other serotypes is partial and temporary, so if a person gets subsequent infections by other serotypes, the risk of developing severe dengue is higher,\u201d warned Dr Aggarwal.\nUnderreporting, underdiagnosis\nDengue hit India the hardest in 2016, when close to 130,000 cases and 245 deaths were reported. For the first time, every state reported cases of the viral fever, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme data shows.\nAs in the past, more cases and deaths this year are in the states with better public health infrastructure than the underserved states, raising fears of underdiagnosis and under-reporting.\nBihar, for example, has reported 845 cases and no deaths, and populated Madhya Pradesh has 1,027 cases and five deaths.\nInternational studies have alleged under-reporting happens at an unprecedented scale in India. A Sanofi Pasteur-funded study in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene said India had nearly six million annual clinically-diagnosed dengue cases between 2006 and 2012, which is about 282 times higher than the officially reported data by the health ministry. Sanofi Pasteur\u2019s dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, is awaiting regulatory approval in India.\nThe discrepancies are possible and often not intentional. \u201cOften, people get treated symptomatically and don\u2019t get tested. Also, testing is more complicated than, say malaria, which can be tested in the field using a simple rapid test,\u201d said Dr Valecha.\nAnother hurdle is that IgM and IgG rapid card tests for dengue sometimes throw up false negative results. A positive IgG but a low or negative IgM, for example, indicates past dengue infection and can be misread by a less informed physician.\nThe confirmatory NS1 Elisa-based antigen test is expensive and costs between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 in private clinics. \u201cDengue has no cure and since the treatment is symptomatic, many people say no to tests, adding to underdiagnosis and under-reporting,\u201d Dr Valecha said.\n\u201cErratic rainfall, temperature and relative humidity patterns are changing epidemiological patterns, and unless real-time tracking is improved, new infection hotspots will keep appearing every year,\u201d Dr Aggarwal said.\nFirst Published: Oct 24, 2017 14:08 IST", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/going-viral-dengue-widens-grip-across-india/story-qT4y5zXLzPtcSW6xOptKGO.html", "label": 1}
