But during 2014 Lok Sabha stumping, you made tall claims about bringing back black money from abroad. \u2018Arre, kahan hai 56-inch waale\u2019 (where is the person with 56-inch chest?), Lalu tweeted.Lalu posted a picture of August 2013 showing the then Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel selling onions as symbolic protest against the then Delhi government\u2019s failure in checking onion prices. He posted a caption also, \u201cDouble standards of Jumla Party\u201d.Talking to reporters, the RJD chief recalled how Goel had launched a campaign in New Delhi against the then Congress government\u2019s failure to check onion prices. \u201cBut, today, these BJP leaders are silent. Why are they not protesting today when the Modi-led NDA government has miserably failed in checking the onion prices?\u201d Lalu asked.In another tweet, Lalu quipped, \u201cWhy the value of Indian rupee is depreciating as low as the value of PM.\u201d", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Lalu-slams-PM-over-rising-onion-prices/articleshow/48644942.cms", "label": 1}
