The protests was organised by Student Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), and was set to begin at 4:30 pm on 29th May. However, the permission wasn\u2019t granted.\nEven before the notified time of protest, many other people who were against the idea of beef fest was present around Town Hall to protest and stop the beef fest from taking place. All of them were taken into custody. Later, around 6:00 pm SFI and DYFI appeared on sight to start protesting, but they too were taken into custody.\nOnly people allowed to remain on sights were journalists and police. All others were taken away. Most were taken to jail while some were dropped off at random pots to avoid the crowd at Town Hall. All the protesters were released before midnight.\nWe could see various social media posts popping up against Mooment Bengaluru. Varkey Parakkal, one of the organisers jokingly remarked, \u201cWe could call this a success. We managed to piss half of Karnataka.\u201d\nShreya Joshi\neditor@economylead.com", "url": "http://www.economylead.com/politics/mooment-bengaluru-beef-fest-a-success-or-a-failure-115975", "label": 1}
