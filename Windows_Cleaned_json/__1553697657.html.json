They would soon be writing to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office about the dates. The congress sees several students, Nobel Laureates and scientists from India\u2019s science academies in attendance. Fresh registrations would now be required, Mr. Gangadhar said.\nSince the days of Jawaharlal Nehru, the ISC was traditionally the first public function the Prime Minister addressed in the calendar year.\nStudent unrest has rattled the OU since December 3 last year, after the suicide of a student and this was among the key reasons that led to its withdrawal as a venue.\nMoreover, funds allotted by the ISCA to the OU to spruce up the campus and prepare for the event were mostly unspent, sources said.\nThe choice of venue is usually decided a year in advance and the massive logistical exercise involves coordinating the visit of several Nobel Laureates, heads of Indian science academies and thousands of students. \u201cWe\u2019ll be writing to the Laureates again and I hope they can come,\u201d Mr. Gangadhar said.\nIn recent years, the Science Congress has also got flak for being a forum that promoted pseudo science, such as in 2014, when a session on mythology and Vedic-era airplanes was a highlight.\nIndia-born Chemistry Laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan had castigated the congress as a \u201ccircus.\u201d\nCourtesy The Hindu", "url": "http://www.thesangaiexpress.com/mu-set-host-indian-science-congress/", "label": 1}
