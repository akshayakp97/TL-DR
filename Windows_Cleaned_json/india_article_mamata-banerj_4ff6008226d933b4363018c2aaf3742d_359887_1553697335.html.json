Sources have said that he will now take a chopper to the West Bengal-Jharkhand border and then travel 20 kilometres by car to Purulia for his rally. Also, since the permission was not given to land his chopper, the venue permission is also awaited.\nSources have also revealed that due to Adityanath\u2019s Z+ category security, his office will take a final call on the rallies in the morning.\nMeanwhile, Chouhan, who was supposed to hold a rally in Kharagpur on February 6 has also got hiccups for similar reasons and his helicopter will land at Kalaikunda (defence airbase) as field permission has not yet been given.\nSimilarly, senior BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain was also supposed to hold a rally in Murshidabad district\u2019s Lalbagh area on February 5 but since his chopper was also denied permission, the event hangs by a thread.", "url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/mamata-banerjee-dharna-kolkata-protest-latest-news-update-cbi-raid-rajeev-kumar-west-bengal-police-yogi-adityanath-rally-denied-permission-again/359887", "label": 1}
