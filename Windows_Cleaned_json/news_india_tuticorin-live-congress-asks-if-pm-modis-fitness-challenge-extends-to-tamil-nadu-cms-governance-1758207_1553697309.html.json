Talking about the inquiry that's going to be held, what sort of an inquiry does not have a time limit? The government is thinking that it will shift into oblivion of public memory the horrors of Tuticorin. Has anybody tried to find which officer readily accepted this project when it was shifted from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu? I want to ask the PM if CM EPS is fit to continue. This is another kind of challenge that we are throwing at the PM. The state government has lost the ethical and moral right to govern. The job of the government is to save human rights and improve their standards of living,\" says Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

He has the free time to accept fitness challenges and even throw counter-challenges but has no time to speak on challenges of violence and rising fuel prices.
