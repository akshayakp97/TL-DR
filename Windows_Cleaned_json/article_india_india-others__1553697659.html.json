Over 300 bandh supporters were also arrested in different towns.\nThe bandh, which was originally called by the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva-Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), was subsequently backed by eleven other groups including the All Bodo Students\u2019 Union (ABSU), All Dimasa Students\u2019 Union, All Karbi Students\u2019 Union, All Assam Sonowal-Kachari Students\u2019 Union, and All Moran Students\u2019 Union. The Asom Gana Parishad too extended support to the bandh.\nThe ministry of home affairs had on Monday issued a notification saying the Centre had decided to exempt \u201con humanitarian considerations\u201d Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals belonging to minority communities who have entered India on or before December 31, 2014 from the relevant provisions of rules and order made under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946, in respect of their entry and stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be.\nAdvertising\nThe Centre\u2019s decision has evoked massive protests in Assam, with the All Assam Students\u2019 Union (AASU) threatening to approach the Supreme Court against it. \u201cWhile Assam has been struggling to protect the indigenous communities from being outnumbered by illegal migrants from Bangladesh, the Centre\u2019s decision will only open the floodgates for more to come,\u201d said AASU general secretary Lurin Jyoti Gogoi.\nThe AASU had on Friday taken out a torch-light protest march in Guwahati, while the AGP had staged a sit-in protest. Former chief minister and senior AGP leader Prafulla Kumar Mahanta said the BJP-led government at the Centre was least bothered about the indigenous communities of Assam. \u201cThe Modi government has further complicated the Bangladeshi influx problem by taking such a decision that will further reduce the indigenous people of Assam into a minority,\u201d Mahanta said.", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bandh-against-centres-decision-on-bangla-pak-minorities-cripple-life-in-assam/", "label": 1}
