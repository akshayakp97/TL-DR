The House had to be adjourned for the day as the protests continued.\nIntroduction of Bills\nIn the Lok Sabha, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan first adjourned the House immediately after the Question Hour started, as the TRS, TDP, AIADMK and YSR Congress members stormed the well.\nThere was no let-up in protests as the House met again at noon but the Speaker went ahead with the proceedings, including the introduction of two Bills by Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla, amid the din.\nBhartruhari Mahtab of the BJD opposed the introduction of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, saying its provisions violated citizens\u2019 fundamental rights and that it is based on the premise of \u201cguilty till proven innocent\u201d and not the other way round. He questioned the provision of seizing assets of an accused before he was proven guilty.\nHowever, Shukla said these provisions can be debated during the discussion on the Bill, and introduced it. Soon after this, the House was adjourned.\nDiverse issues\nThe Lok Sabha has been witnessing similar scenes since March 5, with opposition parties besides the TDP, which remains a member of the ruling NDA though it has pulled out of the Central government, raising a host of issues such as special status for Andhra Pradesh, enhanced reservation in Telangana and constitution of the Cauvery river board to settle Tamil Nadu\u2019s water dispute with neighbours.", "url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/rows-protests-mar-business-in-both-houses/article23163157.ece", "label": 1}
