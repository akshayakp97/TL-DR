The protesting farmers have, in addition to drinking their own urine, worn sarees, eaten dead rats, stripped nude and have worn the skulls of deceased farmers.\nReports say that, P. Ayyakkannu, who is leading the protest, said: \u201cThe government is not giving us water. So, we are consuming urine.\u201d\nThe protesters had on Friday said they would drink urine if the Centre failed to offer a solution to their problems within a day.\nOn April 10, they had stripped in front of the prime minister\u2019s office here to press for their demands Over the last 39 days, they have shaved half of their moustaches and tonsured heads, their kept mice and snakes in their mouth, conducted mock funerals, flogged themselves and carried skulls of other farmers who committed suicide due to debt pressure.\u2013ANI", "url": "https://www.nmtv.tv/tamil-nadu-farmers-drink-their-own-urine-in-protest-for-drought-relief/", "label": 1}
