The overall internet protocol (IP) traffic is expected to grow four-fold from 2016 to 2021, a compound annual growth rate of 30 percent and reach 6.5 Exabytes of data per month in 2021, up from 1.7 Exabytes per month in 2016.\nThe report said that the machine to machine (M2M) connections will represent 22 percent of the total two billion devices and connections and will account for five percent of IP traffic by 2021. The advancements in the internet of things (IoT) applications such as smart meters, package tracking, digital health monitors and a host of other next-generation M2M services is driving this incremental growth\u2014nearly 21 percent increase in the next five years.\nThe video will continue to dominate IP traffic and overall internet traffic growth\u2014representing 76 percent of all internet traffic in 2021, up from 57 percent in 2016. India will reach 84 billion Internet video minutes per month by 2021, which is one hundred and sixty thousand years of video per month, or about 32,000 video minutes every second.\n\u201cMobile networks, devices and connections in India are not only getting smarter in their computing capabilities but are also evolving from lower-generation network connectivity (2G) to higher-generation network connectivity (3G, 3.5G, and 4G or LTE). Combining device capabilities with faster, higher bandwidth and more intelligent networks is leading to wide adoption of high bandwidth data, video and advanced multimedia applications that contribute to increased mobile and Wi-Fi traffic,\u201d said Sanjay Kaul, managing director, service provider business, Cisco India and SAARC.\nHe added, \u201cWe are witnessing a burgeoning rise in usage of mobile applications and connectivity by end users. The need for optimized bandwidth management, network automation, end to end security and ultimately network monetization through cost efficient data production is fuelling the growth of network automation, mass market 4G deployments and adoption, soon to be followed with 4.5G and 5G.\u201d\nHere are some key facts from the Cisco report:\n1.
