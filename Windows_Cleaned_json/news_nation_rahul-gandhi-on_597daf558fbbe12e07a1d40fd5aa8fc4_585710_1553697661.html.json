So lakhs of crores of money is being saved by the government. Where is the money going?\u201d Gandhi asked.\n\u201cWhy are you not saying to people that you don\u2019t want to put GST on petrol and diesel? You want to take away money from common man and want to give it to your five or ten industrialist friends,\u201d he said before the gathering.\n\u201cYou want to take money from the pockets of those driving scooter, truck, bus and other vehicles in the country and want to give it your rich friends,\u201d the Congress leader said.\nDuring his three-day visit, Gandhi will be campaigning in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkballapura, Tumakuru districts and Bengaluru city. \u2014 PTI", "url": "https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-on-bicycle-leads-protest-march-on-petrol-price-in-karnataka/585710.html", "label": 1}
