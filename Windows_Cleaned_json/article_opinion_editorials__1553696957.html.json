Polling was described as varying from \u201cunprecedentedly heavy\u201d in northern states to \u201cmoderate\u201d in several parts of southern India and Rajasthan. Political observers predict a higher turnout than the 61.33 per cent recorded in 1967.

The reason: The movie villain is named Zaalam Singh. The Congress candidate from the Simla reserved constituency is also named Zaalam Singh. The screen Zaalam Singh, in contrast to the living Zaalam Singh, is projected as a person who, after being a goonda in his youth, grows into a tyrant.", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/march-17-1977-forty-years-ago-nation-votes-4572439/", "label": 1}
