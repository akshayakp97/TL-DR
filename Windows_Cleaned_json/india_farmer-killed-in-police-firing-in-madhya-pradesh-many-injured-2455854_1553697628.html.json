A probe has been ordered into the same. Neither has the government ordered for suspension of internet nor is there any curfew or clamp down in place,\" said Madhya Pradesh's Home Minister Bhupendra Singh.\nMeanwhile, the opposition attacked the government for failing to address farmers' issues and letting them down. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to declare that the government was at war with farmers.\nThis Govt is at war with the farmers of our country#Mandsaur #MadhyaPradesh https://t.co/HQsjluDUPg \u2014 Office of RG (@OfficeOfRG) June 6, 2017\nChief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has ordered a judicial probe into the violence that broke out on Tuesday. Despite MP Kisan Sena (MPKS) and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) withdrawing their protest after Chief Minister's assurances, other farmer bodies continued to agitate. The Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh continued their stir on Tuesday. The police opened fire in Mandsaur as the situation got out of hand on in which farmers were killed, worsening the situation further.\nFor days now, farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been protesting demanding higher prices for their produce including onions and dal. Loan waiver is a concern for farmers in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra where protests were witnessed. Protests turned violent in many places across Madhya Pradesh with protesters pelting stones at policemen torching police and other vehicles and vandalising shops.\nInternet services were banned in Ratlam and Neemuch as well following the farmers' protest. Earlier, internet services were suspended in Maharashtra's Nasik which is also witnessing massive farmers' protests.\nOneIndia News", "url": "https://www.oneindia.com/india/farmer-killed-in-police-firing-in-madhya-pradesh-many-injured-2455854.html", "label": 1}
