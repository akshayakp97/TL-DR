The members further requested the Acting Chief Justice and other Judges to not pass any adverse orders in the absence of any of the parties.\nOther lawyers\u2019 bodies in the High Court \u2014 the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Library Club \u2014 have also reportedly supported the strike. However, the Trinamool Congress lawyers\u2019 cell, which concluded its relay hunger strike on the same issue on Friday, has chosen not to join, saying that it was \"not consulted\" before making the decision.\nThe Calcutta High Court is currently functioning at less than half its strength, with only 33 Judges as opposed to a sanctioned strength of 72 Judges. The shortage is only going to contribute further to the 2.2 lakh pendency of cases at the Court.\nThe situation isn't very different at other High Courts as well. In fact, it was just recently that several Bangalore lawyers went on a hunger strike to protest against the ever-growing judicial vacancies at the Karnataka High Court. This was followed by a resolution to cease-work by the Orissa High Court Bar Association, in order to express its \"anxiety\" regarding non-appointment of Judges.", "url": "https://www.livelaw.in/calcutta-lawyers-announce-5-day-cease-work-protest-judicial-vacancies/", "label": 1}
