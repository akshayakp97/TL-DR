However, the Speaker did not accept the motion following which we stood beside our seats and staged a protest\u201d, BJD\u2019s Parliamentary Party spokesperson Kalikesh Singhdeo said while speaking to media persons outside the Parliament.\n\u201cMahanadi is the lifeline of Odisha. We will continue our protest against the illegal construction of barrages over Mahanadi in the upper catchment areas by the Chhattisgarh Government\u201d, he added.", "url": "http://www.pragativadi.com/mahanadi-issue-bjd-mps-seek-adjournment-motion-lok-sabha/", "label": 1}
