The elections are scheduled to be held later Friday afternoon.\nThe chairman\u2019s election was necessitated after council chairman Shivajirao Deshmukh in an unprecedented no-confidence motion was voted out of the office. The veteran Congress leader held the august post in the upper house for 11 years.\nThe NCP enjoys a brute strength of 28 in the house, followed by the Congress (21), BJP (12), Shiv Sena (seven), and the rest belonging to other parties.\non March 19, the Shiv Sena tried to corner ally BJP by fielding Neelam Gorhe for the post in what would be a four-cornered contest between Gorhe, the NCP\u2019s Nimbalkar, the Congress\u2019 Sharad Ranpise and an Independent from Amravati teachers\u2019 constituency, Shrikant Deshpande.\nIn the March 16 voting of the no-confidence motion against Deshmukh, the opposition NCP was virtually \u201chelped\u201d by the BJP to defeat the Congress in the house. Both BJP and NCP were accused of having an \u201cunderstanding\u201d between them over ousting Deshmukh.\n(IANS)", "url": "http://www.economylead.com/politics/bjp-shiv-sena-boycott-legislative-council-chairman-poll-63345", "label": 1}
