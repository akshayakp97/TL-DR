The BJP has alleged that the squatters enjoyed the patronage of the SP leadership, a charge refuted by the ruling party.\nRead: Mathura clashes: Scarred for life, \u2018cult\u2019 children recall \u2018bade pitaji\u2019\nBJP president Amit Shah, in a meeting of party officials in Kasganj on Tuesday, announced that people can email (kabja.hatao@bjp.org) their complaint about illegally occupied land or properties \u2013 whether public or private \u2013 in their areas.\n\u201cThe BJP cadres will launch a people\u2019s campaign to free the properties of illegal occupation. This will put our workers in direct touch with the people on one hand and pit them against the ruling SP on the other. No encroachments can happen without the support of the ruling party,\u201d a BJP leader said in New Delhi.\nReacting sharply to the campaign and the accusation, SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said BJP workers should pass on the information they receive to the state government. \u201cThe BJP is always looking at ways to politicise everything. Is UP the only state where there are encroachments?\u201d\nRead: Violent ideology, bizarre demands: Secretive world of the Mathura cult\nThe BJP also believes the campaign will help it wean Dalits, who make up over one-fifth of the electorate, away from the Bahujan Samaj Party. Politics in the state has been bipolar for the last decade and a half with either the SP or the BSP forming the government.\nThe party says that Dalits are at the receiving end of most cases of illegal occupation of smaller plots of land or private properties.\n\u201cDalits are exploited at the hands of Samajwadi Party, while they are used by the Bahujan Samaj Party\u2026 Dalits can only progress under BJP rule and only BJP can work for their welfare,\u201d Shah said in Kasganj.\nBy the end of the month, Shah would have travelled and connected with booth-level officials of the party from all six regions of UP, a BJP leader said. Each of the 403 constituencies has around 350 booths.\nThe Mathura violence has given the opposition parties enough ammunition to begin the battle for the 2017 assembly elections. Bahujan Samaj chief and four-time UP chief minister Mayawati has attacked the Samajwadi Party and has sought the UP CM\u2019s resignation.\nCongress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has also expressed his displeasure at the \u201csliding law and order in the state\u201d.\nFirst Published: Jun 09, 2016 15:26 IST", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-uttar-pradesh-s-land-grab-cases-bjp-smells-a-political-opportunity/story-fPFSrGwNaEZ612ooLherLK.html", "label": 1}
