Her assurance came after Mr Ravikumar\u2019s mother wrote an open letter to her, which was published in the newspapers.\nMrs Gandhi had also spoken to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah last week and advised him to turn over the case to the CBI.\nOn Sunday, the High Court stopped the government from making public an initial report on what it called the \u201cunnatural death\u201d of the 36-year-old officer.\n\u201cThe respondents are restrained from making or publishing any interim report or making any public statement pertaining to investigation being conducted with regard the unnatural death of DK Ravi\u2026,\u201d Justice Abdul Nazeer said, adding that the investigation can continue.\nThe court acted on a petition by the husband of an IAS officer who knew DK Ravikumar and was the last to have been in touch with him, according to media reports. The woman has reportedly shared information with the state\u2019s Criminal Investigation Department, which is inquiring into the case.\nThe officer was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his apartment last Monday. The police have said it is \u201cprima facie a case of suicide,\u201d a premise questioned by many, including his family and friends.\nLast week, the officer\u2019s family members protested outside the state assembly until the Chief Minister arrived and spoke to them.\nOpposition parties have rejected reports of personal reasons behind the death and say there is more to the case; the officer was known for taking on the sand and land mafia.\n\u201cWe will not allow the government to submit the interim report because that is a deliberate attempt at misleading investigations,\u201d senior BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa said on Sunday.", "url": "http://www.nagpurtoday.in/karnataka-announces-cbi-probe-into-ias-officer-dk-ravis-death/03231155", "label": 1}
