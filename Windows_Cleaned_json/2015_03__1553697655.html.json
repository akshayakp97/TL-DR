One is to protect the self and community, and the other to conquer weaker neighbours.\nHe charged that the Government of India was playing the latter game and threatening the North East People with draconian legislations such as AFSPA.\nHe also said that the present government led by O Ibobi Singh is not friendly to the people and is not a protector of the indigenous peoples.\nSovakiran also said that demanding implementation of the ILP system is for the protection of indigenous peoples of Manipur which included the major and the minor communities, however if there are no laws to protect the indigenous peoples in the State, after a few years the real original of Manipur will vanish.\nThe said Bill passed on March 16 is quiet misleading and instead of seeking to protect the indigenous peoples, it tries to consociated the position of illegal immigrants and migrants who started pouring into the State since the 1950s.\nLastly, he said the said Bill was not thoroughly discussed or debated amongst the members present in the House and hastily pushed through in the Assembly by the ruling party.", "url": "http://kanglaonline.com/2015/03/mpp-to-demand-withdrawal-of-visitors-bill/", "label": 1}
