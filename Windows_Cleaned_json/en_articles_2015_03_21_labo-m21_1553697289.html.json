Workers will strike for four hours in depots and offices at Wallsend, Charlestown and Belmont on March 31, at Gosford, Ourimbah, Somersby, Tuggerah and Singleton on April 1, and at six Hunter region depots on April 8.\nA USU spokesman claimed that job security was the primary concern for workers ahead of the March 28 election, specifically the NSW Liberal government\u2019s plans to privatise the energy network.\nAusgrid claims that it was unable to reach a final enterprise agreement deal until the Australian Energy Regulator decides on the company\u2019s revenue in late April. The union has already reduced its pay demand in order to avoid industrial action before next Saturday\u2019s state election.\nElectrical Trades Union (ETU) members at Ausgrid struck for four hours on March 3 over their wages dispute.

Workers in all federal public sector departments have rejected the offers.

According to a Massey University study, two thirds of employment in New Zealand is classed as casual, part-time or contract.\nPapua New Guinea: Goroka hospital staff and doctors strike again\nDoctors joined striking nurses and other support staff and withdrew their services on March 13 in a long-running dispute with the government and hospital administration for urgently needed equipment and better facilities at the Goroka Base Hospital in Papua New Guinea\u2019s Eastern Highlands.\nThe walk-out followed the temporary mass resignation of 400 hospital workers on January 19, over the dismissal of five senior staff members, including the hospital manager who supported the workers, over the lack of supplies and for improved conditions. The doctors and nurses, who had demanded that the hospital\u2019s board of directors be sacked, returned to work after the health minister announced that a three-man committee would be sent to Goroka to investigate their demands. None of these issues have been resolved.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/03/21/labo-m21.html", "label": 1}
