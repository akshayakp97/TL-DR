Attended by several thousand people, the rally was addressed by TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee, MP Idris Ali and others, who said that West Bengal had always been a land of religious harmony. \u201cThe BJP should not try to disturb this and any such attempt by it will be thwarted by the people of the state,\u201d Chatterjee said. An oath of unity was taken, with representatives of all major faiths, including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Buddhists administering it to those present. The party also held processions in different parts of the state to mark the day.

It was raised just to whip up passions in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2017,\u201d said Mr Kumar in Patna today.

In an editorial in Saamna yesterday, the Shiv Sena said he should now announce a date for its commencement.
