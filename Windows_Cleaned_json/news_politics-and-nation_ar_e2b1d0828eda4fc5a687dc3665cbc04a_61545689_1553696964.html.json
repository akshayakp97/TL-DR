He was speaking hours after former PM Manmohan Singh rubbished demonetisation as an \u201corganised loot and legalised plunder\u201d that had led to job losses and, along with goods and services tax, broken the back of small businesses. \u201cThe anti-black-money step is a moral step.What is morally and ethically correct has to be politically correct,\u201d Jaitley said, while taking on Congress. \u201cLoot is what was done in 2G spectrum allocation, Commonwealth Games scam and coal block allocation. Our and Congress views of what is ethical are different. Their primary objective is to serve the family (Nehru-Gandhis), while ours is to serve the nation,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is surprising that the ethical and moral rationale behind such a move is being called loot.\u201d He said Congress-led UPA had not taken any step to check corruption and black money for the 10 years that it was in power. \u201cWe in BJP believe this status quo needed to be shaken up for the country\u2019s economy and its future,\u201d Jaitley said.\u201cIt is common knowledge that cash is anonymous. When demonetisation was implemented, one of the intended objectives was to put identity on the cash holdings in the economy,\u201d Jaitley wrote in a blog, \u201cA Year after Demonetisation\u201d.", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/arun-jaitley-calls-demonetisation-watershed-moment-says-will-make-india-a-clean-economy/articleshow/61545689.cms", "label": 1}
