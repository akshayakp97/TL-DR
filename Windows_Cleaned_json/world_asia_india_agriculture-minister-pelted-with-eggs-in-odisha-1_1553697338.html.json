Odisha Youth Congress chief Loknath Maharathy was among the arrested.\nCalling him anti-farmer, Maharathy said Radha Mohan Singh had no moral right to be the Agriculture Minister \u201cafter the brutal killing of farmers in Madhya Pradesh ruled by the BJP\u201d.\nCongress leader Pradip Majhi said the \u201cegg attack was carried out to sensitise [the central government], so that the problems of the farmers of Odisha and other parts of the country are addressed\u201d.\nThe angry Congress activists were demonstrating in protest against the death of six farmers in police firing in Mandsaur district, the epicentre of the farmers\u2019 agitation in Madhya Pradesh, which remained calm but tense as authorities allowed a 12-hour relaxation in the curfew from 8am to 8pm on Saturday.\nThe local markets in the Mandsaur city opened as people came out in droves to stock up on daily essentials, District Magistrate O.P. Srivastava said, adding no untoward incident had taken place anywhere in the troubled region.\n\u201cIf the situation continues to be normal, [the] curfew will be lifted [from Sunday],\u201d Srivastava said.\nBut the wholesale agriculture market \u2014 Mandsaur Krishi Upaj Mandi on the outskirts of Mandsaur city \u2014 was yesterday deserted as farmers, who began protesting from June 1 to demand debt relief and price hike in their produce, stayed away from selling their produce for the 10th day.\nAccording to estimates, this has led to losses of several millions of rupees to the agriculture sector in the state. The market on a normal day sees some 5,000 farmers from across Madhya Pradesh and parts of neighbouring Rajasthan selling their produce in an estimated daily turnover of Rs50 million (Dh2.85 million).\nMandsaur and its adjoining Neemuch district were the epicentre of the peasant stir even as protests spread to other parts of the state after police opened fire on farmers on June 6.\nAmid the spiralling protests by Madhya Pradesh farmers, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday began his indefinite fast here \u201cuntil peace is restored\u201d in the state.\nThe Chief Minister has decided to run his office from the BHEL Dussehra Maidan, where he is sitting on fast. He said it would serve as an open forum where farmers and people would be able to approach him directly.\nThe opposition slammed Chouhan\u2019s decision to go on fast.\nMadhya Pradesh Congress chief Arun Yadav said the act was \u201ca farce\u201d.\n\u201cHe has never considered visiting the families of the dead farmers in Mandsaur and also the houses of the 25 persons who died in a blast at a fireworks factory.\u201d\nIn Delhi, CPI-M General Secretary Sitaram Yechury accused the BJP-led central government of turning farming into a \u201closs-making profession\u201d and meeting farmers\u2019 genuine grievances with \u201cbullets\u201d.\n\u201cThe essential point is this: We are not remunerating farmers adequately for their labour and produce. The BJP instead, is meeting their genuine grievances with bullets,\u201d Yechury wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday, referring to the protests in Madhya Pradesh in which six farmers were shot dead by police.", "url": "https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/agriculture-minister-pelted-with-eggs-in-odisha-1.2041562", "label": 1}
