The drive has been endorsed by local Muftis who refuse to solemnise \u2018nikkah\u2019 if the families practice the tradition.\nApproximately 800 families have returned dowry money to the bride\u2019s family, with an accumulating total of over US$900, 000 in the last one year alone.\n\u201cThe war against dowry will eat up poor families like cancer till it is completely wiped out. There are still a few families who are yet to give up the evil practice. Earlier, the Muslim community did not pay dowry, but of late, dowry has become a part of marriages, in the process badly hampering the sanctity of this sacred bond,\u201d Ali said. \u201cWe will also devise a strategy during the next meeting to tackle such families.\u201d\nSalim Ansari, who returned dowry said: \u201cI feel proud to declare that what I had done earlier was wrong. To make things correct, I am returning the money. I will never demand or offer dowry in future.\u201d\nCourtesy: Hindustan Times", "url": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/03/01/indian-muslim-community-protest-against-dowry/", "label": 1}
