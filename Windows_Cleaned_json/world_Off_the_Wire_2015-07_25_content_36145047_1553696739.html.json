Prime Minister Modi said that deliberations are underway involving all stakeholders with regard to conclusion of the Interim Agreements on sharing of waters of Teesta and Feni, as soon as possible. The two Prime Ministers noted that discussions on various aspects relating to the sharing of waters of the Manu, Muhuri, Khowai,Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar rivers were taking place at a \"technical level.\" Endi", "url": "http://china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2015-07/25/content_36145047.htm", "label": 1}
