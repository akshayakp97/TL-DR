Why was there law and order problem? you have an obligation to tell us. Tell your government that law and order is primacy in civilized society and we can't tolerate such incidents. we said the same thing to Karnataka government in the Cauvery matter. When the final arbitrer of the constitution is seized off the issue a complete silence has to be maintained on the issue. You are entitled to come up with an ordinance, an act but we are not on that. We are governed by a concept of rule of law. In rule of law such kind of things shall not happen. Tell your state to take control of law and order. Convey it to the state executive\u201d, Justice Misra told senior advocates K Parasaran, C Vaidyanathan and Rakesh Dwivedi who represented the state of Tamil Nadu.\nWhen Parasaran said the 2014 judgment was being complied with, the bench asked \u201cif judgment is being complied with, how can there be protests...to openly come out in protests on the streets and violate SC order, this is not permissible...we are only concerned with preserving the court\u2019s order and dignity.\nThe animal rights organizations in the petitions contended that the new law passed by Tamil Nadu Assembly to allow Jallikattu has over-reached the earlier verdict of apex court. The court had already reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the 2016 notification. They said things were being done \u201cthrough the backdoor to circumvent the apex court\u2019s earlier directions and it struck at the very basis of the 2014 judgment which banned jallikattu\u201d.\nFollowing public pressure and rising protests against the ban, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has passed the Jallikattu Bill, 2017. Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao has forwarded the Bill to President Pranab Mukherjee who gave his assent.\nWHAT WAS THE AMENDMENT\nAnimal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Department of Tamil Nadu Government had framed Tamil Nadu Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Conduct of Jallikattu) Rules, 2017 by making certain amendments in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. It removes bulls used for jallikattu from under the ambit of \u2018performing animals\u2019 In simple words, as per the amended TN law, the rule and restrictions on \u2018performing animals\u2019 will not apply to the conduct of jallikattu.\nOn January 20, acting on a submission by Rohatgi, SC had agreed not to pass the judgement for a week on the contentious issue. The bench had taken into account the Centre's submission that they were in talks with Tamil Nadu to find a way out in the matter.\nDuring an urgent mentioning, Rohatgi had said \u201c people of Tamil Nadu are passionate about Jallikattu and the Central government and the state are trying to resolve the issue. The Centre and the state are in talks to find a way out in the matter and our request is that the court should not deliver the judgement for at least a week\u201d\nThousands of students gathered on the sands of Marina Beach in Chennai as protests demanding lifting of the ban on bull-taming sport 'jallikattu' snowballed across Tamil Nadu. Faced with mounting anger on the streets, the top brass of the state government got into a huddle as Chief Minister O Panneerselvam decided met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an ordinance for conduct of the age-old sport. He was accompanied by 51 MPs of AIADMK. He appealed to the students to give up their protests even as IT sector employees and several more actors joined the chorus for allowing 'jallikattu'. Meanwhile several celebrities also supported Jallikattu and had urged the SC to lift the ban.\nThis article has been made possible because of financial support from Independent and Public-Spirited Media Foundation.", "url": "https://www.livelaw.in/jallikattu-sc-refuses-stay-new-tn-ordinance-slams-govt-violation-sc-judgment/", "label": 1}
