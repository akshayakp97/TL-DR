Venkatesh, district unit president of Vedike said the MES leaders insulted Kannadigas by observing \u2018black day\u2019. MES activists were also indulging in stone pelting and burning of flags and buntings in Belagavi and surrounding areas on November 1. The State government should conduct a thorough probe into the incident and arrest the miscreants who tried to disturb peace immediately, Mr. Venkatesh said.\nAs the leaders of MES are repeatedly involved in efforts to breach peace, the State government should impose a ban on the organisation. In the wake of the participation of most of the members of Belagavi City Corporation, including the Mayor, in the rally organised to observe \u2018black day\u2019, the State government should supersede the Corporation, he added.\nThe protesters also submitted a memorandum to the office of Deputy Commissioner in this regard. Functionaries of the Vedike R. Manju, Dhananjay and T. Shailesh took part in the protest.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Activists-protest-against-MES-rally/article16437197.ece", "label": 1}
