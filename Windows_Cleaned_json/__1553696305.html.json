Total lawlessness prevails in these states. To draw national attention to the issue, all Left parties will hold a sit-in outside Parliament on July 24,\u201d Yechury told the media.\nHe said: \u201cAfter the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) led alliance government came to power in Tripura in March, four CPI-M members and leaders have been murdered.\u201d\nBesides, hundreds of Left party offices were bulldozed, thousands of houses belonging to Left supporters and leaders were attacked or burnt down, and hundreds of leftists attacked by ruling party cadres.\n\u201cOn the pretext of child-abductions, four people were lynched. The BJP government\u2019s own Minister is involved in spreading rumours that caused much hysteria across Tripura. State\u2019s law and order under BJP has gone down. The state of affairs in Tripura and West Bengal is worse than the 1975 Emergency,\u201d he said after attending a meeting of the Tripura state committee of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M).\nYechury also said hatred and violence allegedly patronised by the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and the BJP continued unabated across the country.\nTerming the government\u2019s recent announcement of Minimum Support Price for certain crops as \u201cfraudulent actions\u201d, the CPI-M leader said the government should follow the Swaminathan Commission\u2019s recommendations on MSP.\nHe said that to oppose the BJP government\u2019s anti-people policies, workers and farmers will organise \u201cjail bharo\u201d (fill prisons) and protest rallies on August 9 and September 5 across the country.\n\u201cThe BJP is trying to get political mileage and electoral victory through communal polarisation in the country.\n\u201cThey are trying to keep the situation in Jammu and Kashmir volatile for political gain. It was expected that during the Governor\u2019s Rule, the situation will improve but it has remained as earlier. Three people, including a young girl, were killed just two days back,\u201d the CPI-M leader said.\nTo a question, the former parliamentarian said his party has decided on the \u201cappropriate electoral tactics\u201d in the light of the political situation and elections in different states.\n\u201cOur main slogan is to \u2018save the country, defeat BJP\u2019. But in West Bengal it will be \u2018save Bengal, defeat Trinamool Congress\u2019 and in Tamil Nadu it will be to \u2018save Tamil Nadu, defeat AIADMK\u2019,\u201d Yechury said.\n\u2013IANS\nsc/tsb/sed", "url": "http://www.canindia.com/left-to-protest-at-parliament-against-tripura-lawlessness-yechury/", "label": 1}
