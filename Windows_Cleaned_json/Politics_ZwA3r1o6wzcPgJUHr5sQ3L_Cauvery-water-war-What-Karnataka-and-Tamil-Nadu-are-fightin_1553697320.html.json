Karnataka argued that its late start should not preclude the fullest development of waters in its territory,\" Guha wrote.\nAfter decades of wrangling that pulled in politicians, film actors and other prominent personalities apart from the common people of the two states, the Central government set up the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal in 1990 to resolve the issue.\nThe tribunal eventually submitted its final order to the government for approval in 2007 after 16 years of hearings, testimonies of 20 witnesses running into 10,000 pages, and representations made by the lawyers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the three main states involved, and Union Territory Puducherry.\nThe Tribunal awarded 419 tmc ft (thousand million cubit feet) of water for Tamil Nadu and 270 tmc ft for Karnataka. Kerala was awarded 30 tmc ft and Pondicherry 7 tmc ft.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of how the dispute played out over the years, pre- and post-Independence.\n1892: The Cauvery river water dispute starts between what was then Madras Presidency (under the British rule) and the Princely state of Mysore. Madras seeks to restrain Mysore from building irrigation systems that would impede the flow of water from 15 rivers (the Cauvery, the Tungabhadra and the Pennar rivers and their tributaries)\n1913: The Mysore government writes to Madras Presidency, seeking permission to build a reservoir. Madras, which plans to build a dam of its at Mettur, refuses consent. This leads to a dispute that results in the arbitration of July 1913. The arbitrator, H.D. Griffin, gives his decision in May 1914, allowing Mysore to go ahead with the construction of the dam up to 11 tmcft.\n1915: Griffin\u2019s decision is challenged by Madras. The secretary to the public works department (irrigation) writes to the government of India, disagreeing with the findings of Griffin. In the same year the Diwan of Mysore also challenges certain parts of the ruling.\n1916: The government of India says it sees no reason to alter or amend the arbitrator\u2019s award. Madras says it is unable \u201cto acquiesce to the decision of the government of India\" and escalates matters to the Secretary of State for India, who stops the arbitrator\u2019s award. He, however, says Mysore is free to enter into talks with Chennai or approach a new tribunal.\n1924: The dispute comes close to being resolved when Mysore and Madras reach an agreement under which Mysore is allowed to build a dam at Kannambadi village. The agreement is to be valid for 50 years and reviewed thereafter. Based on this agreement, Karnataka builds the Krishnaraja Sagar dam.\n1929: An agreement is reached, meant to clarify the 1924 agreement allowing the construction of the Krishnaraja Sagar dam in Mysore and to specify exactly how much water would be released to Madras. Krishnaraja dam becomes functional in 1931 and the Mettur dam in 1934.\nPost-Independence\nAfter India\u2019s Independence, states are reorganized on the basis of language in 1956.
