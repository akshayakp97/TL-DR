Speaking to media, Kuanr said Behera, who was also a noted social activist, was killed by BJD workers. He said, Behera was an aspiring MLA candidate of the BJD. Children of Minster Badri Patra are involved in the murder. Without their direction, no party worker would dare to commit such a heinous crime. The Naveen Patnaik BJD Government, which claims to be a transparent one, should order a CBI probe into the incident, Kuanr said and also demanded that Behera s call records be examined to unravel the truth of his murder. However, Minister Patra refuted the allegations, saying that the BJP is bringing such charges since the party knows that they are going to lose in the elections.","['Ramachandra Behera', 'Anandpur']","['Ramachandra', 'Behera', 'Badri', 'Narayan', 'Patra', 'Kuanr', 'Behera', 'Kuanr', 'Behera', 'Patra']",['Ghasipura Assembly'],"['Ghasipura', 'Assembly', 'SCB', 'Medical', 'College', 'Hospital', 'Congress', 'BJP', 'MLA', 'MLA', 'BJD.', 'Children', 'of', 'Minster', 'Badri', 'Patra', 'Naveen', 'Patnaik', 'BJD', 'BJP']",[],['Behera'],"['Keonjhar', 'Dharakote']","['Former Ghasipura Assembly seat candidate of Keonjhar district Ramachandra Behera was brutally killed by unidentified miscreants allegedly over political rivalry late on Monday night', 'Former Ghasipura Assembly seat candidate of Keonjhar district Ramachandra Behera was brutally killed by unidentified miscreants allegedly over political rivalry late on Monday night']",['Former Ghasipura Assembly seat candidate of Keonjhar district Ramachandra Behera was brutally killed by unidentified miscreants allegedly over political rivalry late on Monday night'],[],"['Former Ghasipura Assembly seat candidate of Keonjhar district Ramachandra Behera was brutally killed by unidentified miscreants allegedly over political rivalry late on Monday night', 'Former Ghasipura Assembly seat candidate of Keonjhar district Ramachandra Behera was brutally killed by unidentified miscreants allegedly over political rivalry late on Monday night']","Sources said the assailants called Behera, an ex Chairman of Anandpur block in the district, from his residence at Dharakote at the night and attacked him with sharp weapons before fleeing from the spot.

According to the SP, Naxals questioned Kashyap about the movement of police personnel and security camps in the area for two days before releasing the duo. Notably, they were abducted from Jabeli village under Aranpur police station area on Sunday morning when Kashyap had gone to consume liquor with Kureti, a contractual teacher in a government primary school there. Kashyap, a district police personnel, is posted at the camp of 'C' company of CRPF's 111th battalion in Sameli village for coordinating between local police and paramilitary personnel during anti Naxal operations.

A group of 40 50 armed Naxals led by militia commander Deva stormed the village and took away the SI and the teacher with them, police said. Naxals questioned Kashyap about the movement of police personnel and security camps in the area for two days. Besides, ultras also warned Kureti to stay away from the police personnel, the SP said. Meanwhile, Naxals also tried to trap security forces by spreading false information that they had killed the abducted SI. But the security forces took all the necessary precautionary measures while searching for their whereabouts in the forest area, he added. Due to mounting pressure from local public representatives and villagers, Naxals had to free the policeman and teacher on Monday late night, the SP said. Kashyap has been suspended for alleged negligence in discharging duty as he went outside the camp without permission and consumed liquor during the duty hours, he said.

Advertising The government has cited the recent suicide bombing of a security forces convoy in Pulwama which killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel as the reason for restricting traffic.

Read Mindless , open air prison Omar, Mehbooba on J K highway ban What is the significance of Jammu and Kashmir s main highway Advertising The lifeline of J K The entire length of the national highway Jammu Srinagar Uri runs 370 km, nearly three fourths of which has been ordered shut to civilian traffic from dawn to dusk on Wednesdays and Sundays. The highway is the lifeline of the Kashmir Valley not just the only road link that connects Kashmir to the outside world but also the key highway that connects Srinagar with the southern and northern districts of the Valley. The highway passes through five of the Valley s 10 districts, and highways to at least two more districts branch out from it. The Jammu Srinagar Uri national highway, directly and indirectly, impacts a population of over 69 lakh. This is the first time in three decades of militancy in Kashmir that the highway has been ordered closed to civilian traffic for two days of the week. A virtual lockdown The order translates into a virtual lockdown of the Valley for two days every week. According to official figures, over 10,000 vehicles move on the highway from both sides every hour, including around 5,000 light motor vehicles. These include vehicles carrying students, patients, government officials and businessmen. Shutting the highway during daytime would mean that most government and private offices, banks, schools and colleges would have to remain shut on Wednesdays, and the movement of people to hospitals would be severely restricted on Wednesdays and Sundays. At least seven important hospitals including three big government hospitals District Hospital Baramulla, Trauma Hospital, Pattan, and SKIMS Medical College Hospital at Bemina, Srinagar are located on the national highway. In addition, at least two colleges, six higher secondary schools, and scores of government and private schools including the Valley s top 10 private ones are on the highway. Almost all colleges, higher secondary institutions and schools in five districts of the Valley are accessible only through this highway. Besides, there are hundreds of villages and towns spread on both sides of the highway from Udhampur to Baramulla. The ban would effectively cut them off from other places on two days every week. Lengthy detours The shutting of the highway means journeys to Srinagar from Anantnag or Awantipora are virtually impossible. To come to Srinagar from Baramulla, commuters will have to travel 20 km to Sopore, and then 60 km towards Srinagar via Sumbal village. Thereafter, a 1 km stretch of the highway cannot be avoided and would have to be covered on foot in the absence of vehicular transport. Srinagar is another 10 km away. In the normal course, the distance from Baramulla to Srinagar on the national highway is only 55 km.","['Mehbooba Mufti', 'Farooq Abdullah', 'Sajad Lone']","['Mehbooba', 'Mufti', 'Farooq',

Investigation has unraveled several aspects of the crime, but many parts lack clarity. The police on March 15 arrested one of Chaudhary s bodyguards, Sunil Singh from Bermo in Bokaro. He confessed that the two brothers were murdered at the news channel s office and named one Dharmendra Tiwari, who also happens to be a private bodyguard. Later on March 19, Tiwari surrendered to the police in Ranchi. During interrogation, Tiwari revealed that Chaudhary and his partner MK Singh had planned a script to take away cash from the Agarwal brothers. On the fateful day, MK Singh walked in the office disguised as an Intelligence Bureau IB official and asked the two brothers to hand over the cash they had with them, Tiwari told the police. Chaudhary and Singh had planned to take away the cash by scaring the two brothers. However, when the Agarwal brothers refused to get intimidated by their script, Chaudhary and Singh asked Tiwari to shoot the two brothers dead. Tiwari has confessed of firing three rounds of bullets at the Agarwal brothers, sources said. While the police have not officially commented on the amount of cash the two brothers were carrying, sources said that they had at least Rs.5 lakh cash in their bag. Interrogation has revealed a lot about the case so far. The manhunt is on and the two prime accused will be nabbed soon, said Sujata Vinapani, Ranchi Superintendent of Police. She added that the police will detach the properties owned by Chaudhary and Singh if they do not surrender or get arrested soon. During interrogation, one of the arrested bodyguards Sunil Singh told the police that he and Tiwari had set ablaze mobile phones of Agarwal brothers. The accused had also burnt their own clothes after the coldblooded murder in a bid to ensure that no evidences were recovered from the spot. The police have also recovered the DVR of the CCTV cameras installed in the office.

Notably, Nayak was a Minister from 2009 to 2011 until he was removed from the State Cabinet for his alleged involvement in May 29 coup against the CM. Following his removal from the Cabinet, people lost confidence in him and anti incumbency factor also led to his defeat in 2014. Giving ticket to Nayak in 2014 election was a setback for the BJD as well, according to observers. Calling him corrupt on one hand and awarding a party ticket to him on the other was actually a blunder, which was reflected in the result, said Narayan Prasad Das, a senior political observer. Although, Dilip Ray has resigned from the BJP and announced not to contest from Rourkela anymore, still the BJD has to be very cautious to nominate a proper candidate to recapture the seat, he feels. Sharada Nayak, besides his damaged goodwill factor, has not been able to contribute any eye catching development as the Chairman of Rourkela Development Authority, which he had received as a gift from the party supremo after his defeat. Stiff hike of holding tax, defective Sarbakhyama policy and no new housing projects during his tenure have aggravated public's ire against him. Besides, Nayak is also facing tough challenges from the BJD rank and file, as a group of BJD workers under the leadership of former Rourkela Municipality Chairperson Rashmibala Mishra has launched a tirade against him.

He and three others were detained after rangers stumbled upon their campsite and found guns and animal carcasses, including a Kalij pheasant, a red muntjac or barking deer and the pelt of a black leopard. While Premchai was found not guilty of possessing a leopard carcass, he was convicted of three other poaching related charges. The verdict, handed out in a statement to reporters waiting at Thong Pha Phum courthouse, said Premchai was sentenced altogether to 16 months . Two others caught with him his driver and cook received lesser sentences, while his hunting guide was sentenced to three years and five months.

Police restricted our journey so that more protesters could gather. They said they wouldn't take off the holy beads wore as part of penance till they had a darshan of Lord Ayyappa.

The rights of the union are equally important. Security of India, sovereignty, dealing with terrorism, managing the borders, custom check points, income tax enforcement are all amongst the several constitutional powers of the union. If the states stand in way of any of them it is guilty of breaching federal norms. Can a state barge its police into the customs area and direct the customs as to what is to be done This would be a threat to federalism, he said. Jaitley said many states have stopped giving police security to income tax authorities when they conduct their operations. Alternatively, when state police is asked for, the information is leaked out to the political government and it reaches the targets of the operations. Tax authorities increasingly have to rely on central forces. In the Kashmir valley recently, searches were conducted under the governor's rule after 17 years.

Another issue, which is weakening the Maoist base is that there is a wide gap between senior cadres of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. As there is hardly any recruitment in Odisha, young cadres are roped in from Chhattisgarh, who have the language problem to deal with Telugu speaking cadres.

Sources in police confirmed that two more people have been detained and are being questioned. A senior police official said that Mahesh Kumar was apprehended from Bhondsi on Friday evening. The official said that all the accused have been identified who were involved in the crime. Efforts are on to nab them, he said. A team of senior police officers are closely investigating the matter. The probe teams are on the job and we will arrest more of the accused soon. The incident is highly sensitive but not communal. I will appeal to all not to spread rumours and disrupt peace. A Police Control Room PCR van has been stationed outside the victim s house. No further violence has been reported from the area, said Police Commissioner, Muhammad Akil. Though the district police have arrested one of the culprits, tension still prevails in the area that has been converted into a fortress with heavy deployment of police force. The local panchayat is reportedly mediating between the two families for a compromise. We were assured of a speedy investigation and quick action by the city police, but only one person has been arrested so far. We have warned police that if more progress is not made and more people are not apprehended, we will reach the Police Commissioner s office on Monday to demand action, said a member of the Muslim Ekta Manch, which has been assisting the victim s family. The incident took place after some of the accused allegedly approached the boys from the family, who were playing cricket outside, and demanded that they go to Pakistan and play . According to the FIR, the incident took place around 5 pm, at the home of Mohammad Sajid, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and has been living here for the last three years with his wife Sameena and six children. In the complaint, Sajid s nephew Dilshaad, who was among those beaten up, said the trouble started when he was playing cricket with some others in a vacant plot near the house. Two unknown men came on a bike and hurled communal abuses. An argument started when they asked our boys to go and play cricket in Pakistan. They began fighting and when my uncle Sajid intervened, the boy sitting at the back of the bike slapped him. Later a mob of drunken men came to our home and attacked us with bhalas spears , lathis sticks and talwars swords . On seeing them, we ran into the house, and they all began demanding that the men come out or they will kill us. When we did not go out, they forced their way into the house and started beating us up, he alleged. In the minutes that followed, one of the family members shot the entire attack on his mobile phone and soon the video became viral on social media. We are planning to either move back to our village or to Delhi. If this has happened here once, it can happen again. Even if something like this happens in our village, at least we will have 15 20 people who will stand by us. We are feeling alone here, said Mohammad Sajid, the victim.

Amin was studying BBA in a Srinagar college Amin, originally a resident of South Kashmir s Shopian, was found injured on the National Highway, with injuries behind his ear and on right hand. Sources said he got injured as he tried to trigger the blast. Sources said Owais has been shifty when questioned by security forces. He first claimed that he was abducted by a group of 14 15 armed Hizb militants, whose faces were covered. He was asked to launch the suicide attack. On further questioning, he said he was given Rs 1 lakh to launch Pulwama attack. Intelligence agencies and J K Police are not so far buying any of his statements as they seem he is cooking up some of the statements. New trend While the priority is to treat him in Ramban and then take him to Jammu. Only on sustained interrogation will we know the truth, a top source told India Today TV. Moreover, sources feel that Amin is part of the new crop of silent recruitment underway in Kashmir Valley people who have no past link with any terror group. Detection of these recruits will be difficult with no evidence, no viral photos, no social media post. A recruit with the clean slate would be harder to detect. For the attack, he said to have got in touch with the Lashkar e Taiba commander Rayeez Ahmed. Sources said unlike the February 14 Pulwama terror attack where planning was done in Pakistan, in this case, the planning and plotting seems to have been done locally. This is a major worry for security forces as they prepare for the Lok Sabha polls. The car that was involved in the failed operation was fitted with two LPG cylinders one of 15 kg, the other of 5 kg it also had petrol, a 9 volt battery, a jerry can filled with suspected nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, gelatin sticks, urea and sulphur basic ingredients to make an improvised explosive device IED . The material were locally procured and executed by a local terror operative. The car, a Hyundai Santro, had fake number plates. It is said to be from Haryana and most likely stolen. The chassis number and engine number were found to be a mismatch. The attack is being seen as a security lapse by officials. Replaying the attack The low intensity blast inside the private car took place on Jammu Srinagar highway, near the Jawahar Tunnel, when a 33 convoy carrying 200 CRPF soldiers was passing by. The car hit a CRPF bus from the rear at around 10.25 am. The bus belonged to the 54th Battalion. The 10 personnel on board had a lucky escape as the plan for a Pulwama like attack failed. The only damage to the bus was the broken rear glass windows. The car caught fire as the cylinders exploded. Owais escaped into a hamlet. A two page note was recovered from the car however, security forces said that they are investigating whether it was planted after the blast. In the note, Amin owned up to the attack, but sources said seemed to have chickened out at the last minute. Amin specifically referred to the youngest pellet gun victim, Hiba Nissar, and Kashmiri teacher Rizwan Asad Pandit who died in police custody on March 19. The note vowed to avenge atrocities committed by the security forces. A team from the National Investigation Agency NIA visited the spot on Sunday. Meanwhile, the director general of CRPF RR Bhatnagar also rushed to Jammu.

Jagatsinghpur is a general constituency which comprises Jagatsinghpur Municipality and Jagatsinghpur and Naugaon blocks. Dalit leader, former Minister, BJD district president and Deputy Chairman, State Planning Board Bishnu Chanran Das has a strong influence in the district. The youth mass and the student community comprise 40 per cent of the electorate who strongly demand nomination of Amarendra Das for the Jagatsinghpur seat. He is a former student leader and young advocate, who has been associated in the student and youth politics of the district over the last one decade. Amarendra has been instrumental in electing student leaders from almost all colleges of the district during the college union elections. Sources said that Amarendra too enjoys the confidence and trust of district BJD president Das and he is loyal to the BJD by every inch. We are pretty sure that Amarendra Das is a strong candidate, said district BJD vice president Dipti Das. As regards Tirtol, it comprises Biridi, Raghunathpur and Tritol blocks. In 2009, Rabindranath Bhoi was elected from the seat while in 2014 Dr Rajashree Mallick was elected. But now the two BJD leaders have turned unpopular in the area with their alleged involvement in questionable acts. Besides, they have failed to popularise the pet schemes of the BJD Government in the constituency. Political observers of the district therefore feel that in the prevailing scenario, Das would fit the bill. Biridi block which was previously in the Jagatsinghpur constituency is now in Tirtol constituency. Das enjoys massive support of Biridi Block which is virtually an invincible fortress for him. In addition, Das has a support base in Raghunathpur and Tirtol areas too. Various organisations of Tirtol constituency including youths, students, farmers and women strongly demand that Das be fielded as BJD nominee this time from the Tirtol seat. Any machination to deprive Bishnu of a ticket for the Tirtol Assembly segment may spell doom for the BJD, cautioned Rajkishore Khatua, a BJD loyalist and former president of Jagatsinghpur Bar Association. As regards Balikuda Erasama, sitting BJD MLA Prasant Muduli s support base has taken a beating. It is learnt that Dr Damodar Rout who intends to fight from this seat on a BJP ticket is facing serious challenges from the BJP rank and file with one Raghunandan Das emerging a strong aspirant. Thus political observers feel that it will be in the advantage of BJD if it fields a new face and that too, a woman. Notably one Basanti Pradhan, former Chairman of Erasama Block and former Zilla Parishad Member, who has her strongholds in Erasama and Balikuda, is a BJD ticket hopeful in the segment. Paradip occupies a pivotal place not only for entire Odisha but also especially for Jagatsinghpur district. It was the former place of Dr Rout who has recently switched over to BJP. In that case the workers of Dr Rout are not going to support Debasis Samantray, who is an aspirant from the seat. The voters of the constituency are now are confused owing to possible contest between Dr Rout from BJP and his son Sambit on a BJD ticket. Again, veteran trade union leader of Paradip Santosh Kumar Pattnaik has joined the race for the BJD nomination. Pattnaik has been working relentlessly over the last two decades for strengthening pro BJD labour union activities. Moreover, Pattnaik has a wide fan base.

Sent into bat, Delhi Capitals notched up an imposing 213 for six in the stipulated 20 overs, and buried under a pile of runs, there was not much of a riposte from the hosts, who were stopped at 176 in 19.2 overs after an injured Bumrah failed to show up with the willow.

He said that if the moon was sighted on May 5, the month of Ramzan would begin from May 6.

All India Muslim Women s Personal Law Board president Shaista Amber also voiced her reservation over the poll schedule.

If the Election Commission could adjust election dates, it would help Muslim voters to exercise their franchise in Ramzan, he said. If the Election Commission looks at its decision and adjusts the dates so that they don t clash with Ramzan, it will be better, he said.

Dinesh Kumar, assistant sub inspector with the Delhi Traffic Police, and his accomplice Pintoo were arrested, days after the bodies of Preeti, 32, and her fianc Annu Chauhan, 26, were found in a temple in 'Sai Upwan' near the Hindan river, police said. An FIR was lodged by the girl's father Pramod Kumar, DIG Upendra Agarwal said. Dinesh reportedly told police that he was in a relationship with the woman, Preeti, for the past 12 years. When he proposed marriage to her, she declined, and instead told him of her wish to get engaged to Annu Chauhan, who owned a glass shop in Ghaziabad. On March 25, Dinesh shot Annu and Preeti with his service revolver as they were coming out of a temple. The duo died on the spot. Police said Dinesh was all the more angry with Preeti because she had changed her phone number a week before the murder and had severed all contact with him. The accused has told us during questioning that he killed the woman and her friend because she had been ignoring him for some time and had even changed her phone number so that the traffic inspector could not contact her. What angered him all the more was that the woman was going to get engaged to another man, said Upender Kumar, the Ghaziabad SSP.

On March 25, Dinesh and his friend Pintoo followed the couple's scootie when they were on their way to the Sai temple in 'Sai Upvan', officials said. When the couple came out of the temple, Dinesh had a heated argument with them and in a fit of anger shot them. Police have recovered a 9 mm service pistol, three live cartridges and the car which was used in committing the crime. Annu, who lived in Sarvodaya Nagar, and Preeti, who was from Pratap Vihar, had been in a relationship for the past three years and were going to get engaged in a few days when they were shot dead. Annu, originally from Uttarakhand, had been running a glass shop in Ghaziabad for the past few years, while Preeti worked at a private school in Indirapuram.
