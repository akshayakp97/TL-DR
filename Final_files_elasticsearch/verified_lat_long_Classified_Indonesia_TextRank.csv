Last Sunday, Indonesia s easternmost province suffered another blow flash floods killed at least 79 people in Sentani, near Papua s capital, Jayapura. Indonesia will head to the polls on April 17 for the presidential election, but the issue of Papua has been neglected . Both candidates the incumbent, Joko Jokowi Widodo, and his challenger, Prabowo Subianto don t seem to prioritise Papua in their campaigns. The small number of Papua voters may not be significant for both candidates. These 3.5 million voters account for less than 2 of the total votes . However, politically, Papua is a strategic topic. National interests are at stake. Papuan activists, both domestically and abroad , are increasingly campaigning for freedom. Some Pacific countries have raised Papua s human rights issues in United Nations forums. But Indonesian political elites still don t see Papua as a political issue. Its absence from the presidential campaign means this issue is being depoliticised. Both the government and the opposition still consider Papua s main problem is lack of economic development. Having this perspective, they oversimplify the issue. A sensitive topic Both presidential candidates seem to be reluctant to touch on the politically sensitive topic of Papua in their campaigns. At least two factors explain this. The first is the candidates track records and their supporters political preference. Papuan activists regard both candidates as having lousy track records in Papua particularly in relation to political affairs, law enforcement and human rights. Even though Jokowi is popular for his infrastructure initiatives in Papua, many argue he made no progress in meeting his promises to resolve human rights cases in the province. He has not kept his promise to resolve the Paniai case . People s disappointment deepened after Jokowi recruited alleged human rights offenders to his administration. As for Prabowo, Papuans still can t get over what the former general has done to them. In 1996, he led a military operation in Mapenduma, Nduga, which had a traumatic effect on Papuans. Prabowo s involvement in the kidnapping of pro democracy activists during the 1998 transition to democracy was another part of his dark record on human rights issues. Also, Papuans link Prabowo to the late President Soeharto, who was responsible for numerous military operations in Papua during the New Order era. The second reason both candidates depoliticise the issue of Papua is that they do not want to disappoint their potential voters. Even though they are competing with each other, Prabowo and Jokowi depend on support from three similar groups to win the election the Islamic group, the nationalist group and the military. For these groups, Papuan integration with Indonesia is non negotiable. This rules out any discourse on secession, which is likely to arise when the issues of Papua are discussed. Thus, the two candidates are playing safe by not talking about Papua. The history The depoliticisation of Papua started when the government issued the 2001 Law on Special Autonomy for Papua . The government issued the law to suppress Papuan people s demand for independence. The Papuan people had voiced this demand during the Second Papuan People s Congress in June 2000. That congress recommended Papua separate from Indonesia. Then the law was issued as a middle way to bridge the antagonistic relationship between the government and Papuan people. To do so, the law is designed to cover broad themes, including political, governance, cultural and economic dimensions. At that time, the law which was mainly formulated by intellectuals and Papuan activists gave hope of a peaceful resolution in Papua. However, the government was deemed inconsistent in implementing the law. One example was the failure to form a Truth and Reconciliation Commission or KKR to help with the historical rectification of Papuan integration with Indonesia as well as resolve human rights cases. The government did not form KKR because the Constitutional Court annulled the law to establish the committee for being contrary to the Indonesian Constitution. Besides, each regime seems to prefer to focus more on Papua s economic development, while overlooking the political and human right issues, as the region s biggest problem . The government s pursuit of economic development has cast aside the need of Papuans for a process of reconciliation to heal the wounds from the past. The government compensates for the shortcomings of the Special Autonomy Law by issuing several presidential decrees . Aiming to accelerate development in Papua, these decrees take the Papuan issue further away from politics as its main problem. In a 2017 presidential decree , politics was not mentioned even once. The same goes for the decree s action plan . It seems politics has disappeared from Jakarta s narrative for Papua. Political process as a peaceful solution The issue of Papua is by nature political it involves the question of state legitimacy. Unfortunately, both the governments and political elites insist on framing Papua only as an economic development problem. The lack of discussion on Papua during the election campaign underlines the missing political dimension in solving Papuan problems. Approaching the nation s fifth democratic election, Indonesians should be able to discuss national issues more openly. The government should have learned from the Aceh peace process, which involves reconciliation via political processes. As with Aceh, the root of Papuan problems is a political matter, which should be dealt with politically as well. Ignoring this will not solve the problems but instead trigger new problems. The presidential election could have created momentum to refresh ideas in formulating solutions for Papua. For that reason, the first step to take is to involve Papua in every part of the country s historical events, including the national election. Reza Pahlevi translated this article from Indonesian.

Our people have been sick of corruption and being unfairly treated. Why Because much of Indonesia's wealth has been taken out of the country, he told several thousands of supporters who flocked to the field to hear his campaign speech. Therefore, if he won the presidential elections, due to be held on April 17, and became the Indonesian president, he would build a corruption free government for bringing justice and prosperity to the people at large, said Prabowo, the founder of the Great Indonesia Movement Party Gerindra . He reiterated his statement that the leak of state funds was predicted to reach around Rp1,000 trillion but many elites in the country were unhappy with what he has said. In response to his statement, the political elites asked him to prove it. I said, please ask the government. Why do you ask me If I were the Indonesian president, I would be responsible for that, he told thousands of his supporters attending his campaign. Subianto then conveyed his pledge that he would resolve the state fund leak if he were elected Indonesian president. As part of his strategies in combating corruption, he would raise the salaries of law enforcers, including judges, prosecutors, as well as police and military personnel. The salaries of our judges need significantly be increased because they should not be bribed. The judges are the last resort for our people to complain. Thus, if the salaries get increased, they think of our people, he said, adding that he had spent more than 30 years of his life as a soldier of the Indonesian military. As a soldier, he thought that whatever the military personnel received were all from the people, Prabowo Subianto who chose Sandiaga Uno as his running mate to challenge the Joko Widodo Ma'ruf Amin pair in the upcoming presidential race. Subianto has repeatedly expressed his deep concern over the state budget leak saying that its percentage could reach up to 25 percent. Regarding Subianto's statement, Vice President Jusuf Kalla has defended the ongoing efforts to eradicate corruption in Indonesia, affirming that the endeavors have been so fierce that state officials are deterred from committing the crime. Corruption does exist, but the efforts to eradicate the crime are also so fierce. Only the brave individuals, who have no fear of being arrested, commit this crime, Kalla said in Jakarta last February. In combating the crime of corruption, a fair law enforcement is applied, as can be observed from those arrested and tried in court. Among the convicts are regional leaders, ministers, and members of parliament, Kalla pointed out. Please show me a country, whose 40 legislators, more than 100 regional leaders, and nine ministers were arrested on corruption charges. Please find another country with so tough corruption eradication like Indonesia , he emphasized. In January 2019, for instance, the Corruption Eradication Commission KPK investigators arrested eight people, including Mesuji District Head Khamami, on graft charges. The anti graft body's spokesman, Febri Diansyah, remarked that during the raid, the KPK investigators seized a cardboard box containing banknotes of Rp100 thousand denomination. The amount of money in the box was estimated to reach around Rp1 billion. The money might be part of the fees for last year's infrastructure projects of the Mesuji Public Works and People s Housing Office, he stated. In April 2018, Chief of the Task Force of Prevention Coordination and Supervision of KPK Asep Rahmat Suwandha revealed that 93 regional leaders, including 18 governors and 75 district heads and city mayors, had been named suspects in corruption. Responding to a question concerning the statement of Prabowo Subianto, contender of incumbent President Joko Widodo in the upcoming presidential race, that the percentage of the state budget leaks could reach up to 25 percent, Vice President Kalla expressed disagreement to his opinion. As revealed in various corruption cases that judges handled in courts, the average mark up percentage of the development budget was between seven and 15 percent, he noted, adding that corruption crimes may occur in any country, including Indonesia, which has actively been carrying out infrastructure construction projects over the past years. Kalla noted that the state budget generally and frequently targeted by the corruptors was related to the development budget. Thus, a statement that the state budget leaks could reach 25 percent was untrue. In connection with the 2019 presidential election, the General Election Commissions KPU has allowed the two pairs of presidential and vice presidential candidates to conduct open campaigns from March 24 to April 13, 2019. The KPU has also prepared five rounds of presidential debates, broadcast live by several television channels. The presidential debates and open campaigns are expected to help some 192 million eligible voters, who will participate in this democratic process, to become well informed on the two pairs' capacity and capability. Empowered with sufficient information about the candidates, they will be able to vote rationally. The government has even set a target that the parliamentary and presidential elections, due to be held simultaneously throughout the country on April 17, will be participated in by at least 77.5 percent of the total number of voters.

He said the crime apparently occurred one day before the body was found by locals on Tuesday morning March 26 . MZ was allegedly raped before she was killed. She was found by the locals with no pants and shirt open, Adj Sr Comm Doni told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday.

On the ride back to the church in the afternoon, they were allegedly intercepted by two individuals who had covered their faces with masks and sarongs. Adj Sr Comm Doni said both MZ and NP were taken to the plantation area, where they were tied up with tyre rubber and strangled. NP survived the incident apparently because she had fainted and was thrown into bushes. Mr Arisman Manai, another pastoral candidate at the GKII church, said that he and other members of the church tried to discover MZ and NP's whereabouts after they grew worried when the woman and the girl did not come back from the market by nightfall.

The people immediately looked for MZ at the location the girl indicated, and found that the woman had already died.

JG Photo Jakarta. The Public Opinion Survey Association, or Persepi, challenged presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto and his campaign team on Saturday to prove his claims of victory in the 2019 presidential election, which contradict the results of all other quick counts conducted by the organization's members. Prabowo has claimed victory on at least three occasions since the April 17 election and called on his supporters not to trust the quick count results published by a dozen pollsters, which all show a win for the incumbent, President Joko Jokowi Widodo, and his running mate, Ma'ruf Amin. During one of his victory claims, the former Army general said this was based on internal data compiled by his campaign team, which showed that he had won 62 percent of the vote in the real count. We are ready to expose the source of our data. However, we hope Prabowo's camp can also show us which pollsters they have used as reference. Are they ready to open access to their data Persepi secretary general Yunarto Wijaya said at a press conference in Jakarta, as reported by Suara Pembaruan. Yunarto is also the executive director of pollster Charta Politica. The national campaign team of Prabowo and his running mate, Sandiaga Uno, reported six pollsters to the General Elections Commission KPU on April 18, accusing them of having published quick count results that were misleading and dangerous to public opinion. KPU chairman Arief Budiman said the agency would review the report and added that only registered and verified pollsters may conduct and publish quick count results. Forty research agencies have registered with the KPU for this year's simultaneous presidential and legislative elections. Quick count activity is legal. It is acknowledged by the Election Law, Persepi chairman Philips Vermonte said in a statement. He dismissed allegations by the Prabowo camp that the association's members had manipulated the data or used the wrong methodology to determine the quick count results. We will open our data if we are asked. Now, we want the party asking us to open our data to also open its data, said Vermonte, who is also executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS . Eight Persepi members Indikator, Charta Politica, Populi Center, Saiful Mudjani Research Center, Indonesia Survey Circle, CSIS, Indobarometer and Pol Tracking presented their data to the public on Saturday to explain the methodologies they had used to conduct the quick counts. Their surveys show Jokowi Ma'ruf winning between 54 percent and 55 percent of the vote, while rival pair Prabowo Sandiaga won between 44 percent and 45 percent. These results are based on data collected from a sample of between 2,000 and 3,000 polling stations nationwide, from a total of about 813,000. PDI P Performs Its Own Real Count The ruling Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle PDI P told the media on Friday that it uses an internal mechanism to perform a real count. It has a counting room in each district branch office across Indonesia that records election data on the ground, in real time. These counting rooms are equipped with between 50 and 400 computers, depending on the number of voters in the district. The party has received data based on more than 10.6 million votes counted as of Friday afternoon. This allows it to have accurate information, including the number of seats it has won on each level of government. The PDI P is the main backer of Jokowi Ma'ruf. We have the data and infrastructure. If another party claims to have won 62 percent of the vote in the presidential election, can it show us the evidence PDI P secretary general Hasto Kristiyanto said, as reported by BeritaSatu.com. He urged all parties to wait until May 22, when the KPU will announce the official result.

The subdistrict, which is home to Southeast Asia's biggest textile market, is popular among street vendors who crowd the sidewalks in the hope of cashing in on the thousands of people flocking to the area every day.

The relocation is to proceed we will do it professionally. We expect the public to respect our field officers, Anies told journalists on Monday. Efforts by the Municipal Police Satpol PP to forcefully remove the street vendors and seize their wares were met by chaos on Thursday last week, when they started pelting officers with stones. Vested Interests No casualties were reported in the incident, but it left a mounting social problem that may soon escalate. Central Jakarta Deputy Mayor Irwandi blamed last week's clashes on local thugs, known as preman, whom he said consider the relocation of the street vendors as a threat to their livelihoods.

This leading region in the Republic of Papua Province has a community that still has difficulty speaking Indonesian and mainly lives in Mosso Village, one of the villages in the Muara Tami District. Kampung Mosso has many indigenous Papuans who still have associations with the citizens of Papua New Guinea PNG , so it's no wonder that the use of English Fiji native language is common. However, language barriers have not dampened the enthusiasm of these border residents to participate in the elections, which will be held on April 17, 2019. The Borderline Ondoafi Tribal Chief of Skouw Wutung, Stanis Tanfa Chilong, who has since become an Indonesian citizen WNI and settled in Kampung Mosso, has ensured all his family members own a KTP self identity card to be able to vote. Being a long term Indonesian citizen, Stanis, who conducts bintara coaching and ensures public order Babinkamtibmas security in Mosso village Nurdin Makuasang, knows Indonesia's laws and regulations, and as such, knows the requirements to become an eligible voter. Children without ID cards cannot vote, Stanis told Antara in his Indonesian PNG style English Fiji. For Stanis, who has 12 sons, all of them have a KTP and can cast their ballots, while other relatives who have just joined the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia NKRI and have not completed population administration formalities cannot vote. Stanis, who claims to be happy being an Indonesian citizen, and expresses his desire to live in Mosso village till he dies, said that his party had just recorded the arrival of Skouw Wutung border ondoafi relatives around seven families who were all not yet equipped with ID cards and could not take part in the elections. Need for population survey The RI PNG Border Area in Jayapura City will soon have two polling stations located in Mosso Village Hall and a helipad field in front of the local Pamtas Task Force Tactical Post, where there are some 161 families with an estimated 500 600 people. However, data has not been updated since the border market fire incident one year ago, as many border residents who are generally traders and whose stalls and kiosks were gutted, eventually returned to their villages. So, this border region has three RTs, of which RT 1 are mostly border crossers who are Indonesian citizens, while RT 2 and 3 are border market traders, said Chief of the Police Post Kapospol Skdaw Ipda Kasrun Subsector. According to him, the awareness of border communities about using their voting rights has increased compared to the previous years. Even though Tuesdays and Thursdays are the market days at the border, residents who work as traders can first come to the polling station to cast their votes and then head to the market to sell their wares. Although awareness has increased, there is a need for a proper population survey to be carried out immediately by the local Election Commission KPU . Stating that now, many PNG residents had just entered the territory of Indonesia and many of their families had become Indonesian citizens but had not been properly recorded, he hoped the KPU would immediately carry out a survey, so they could vote in the future. With this survey, residents who come to the polling station can vote without being accompanied by polling station officials or witnesses, as in previous years, and head home without it interfering with their respective professions, which include gardening and selling, bintara coaching and public order Babinkamtibmas security. In the previous years, in anticipation of untoward circumstances, Babinkamtibmas often requested the assistance of the Border Security Pamtas Task force whose task was to confine border residents in their respective neighborhoods, so that they could go to the polling station first and then proceed with their work of gardening or selling. Otherwise, the voting time can get delayed. If the process is delayed beyond 1p.m., it is not because of the large number of citizens, but the time taken to wait for the community members to come to the polling station, Nurdin said. Officers at the polling station, Babinkamtibmas and the ranks of the local village government must call on residents in their respective settlements. The absence of telecommunication signals also complicates communication, and officers become confused, unless someone asks for help and assistance from the security task force. In search of solutions For the KPU of Papua Province, preparations for the implementation of the elections, especially in the RI PNG border area, are hindered by several factors, including language, data on the number of voters who keep moving and ownership of ID cards or identity cards. Nevertheless, the commissioner of the Papua Province KPU in Tarwinto Election Socialization admitted that until now, there had been no survey carried out in the RI PNG border area in Jayapura City, but it was scheduled. In addition, solutions to the changing number of citizens are being sought, namely if there is no public data, it will be included in the special voter data and adjusted to the determination of the number of ballots that are still being debated. For those with an ID card, it is certain that they are Indonesian citizens, so it is impossible for dual citizens to vote. It is the duty of the government officials in the local village to check and monitor the process, Tarwinto said.",['Muara Tami District'],"['Stanis', 'Babinkamtibmas']",['RI'],"['RI', 'PNG', 'PNG', 'Muara', 'Tami', 'District,', 'Jayapura', 'City.', 'Muara', 'Tami', 'District.', 'Kampung', 'Mosso', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'PNG', 'The', 'Borderline', 'Ondoafi', 'Tribal', 'KTP', 'Nurdin', 'Makuasang,', 'PNG', 'KTP', 'Unitary', 'State', 'RI', 'PNG', 'Pamtas', 'Task', 'Force', 'Tactical', 'Police', 'Post', 'Kapospol', 'Skdaw', 'Ipda', 'Kasrun', 'Subsector.', 'Election', 'Commission', 'KPU', 'PNG', 'KPU', 'Border', 'Security', 'Pamtas', 'Task', 'Nurdin', 'said.', 'Officers', 'KPU', 'PNG', 'Papua', 'Province', 'KPU', 'Tarwinto', 'Election', 'Socialization', 'PNG']",[],"['Jakarta', 'Indonesia', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Republic', 'of', 'Papua', 'Province', 'Fiji', 'Mosso', 'Indonesia', 'Jayapura', 'City', 'Mosso', 'Village', 'Hall', 'Indonesia', 'Jayapura']","['Jakarta', 'Indonesia', 'the Indonesia Papua New Guinea', 'Kampung Skouw', 'Jayapura City', 'the Republic of Papua Province', 'Mosso Village', 'the Muara Tami District']","[""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City""]","[""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City""]",[],"[""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City"", ""News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City""]","News Focus A glimpse into the voting preparation at the RI PNG border Jakarta ANTARA With Indonesia's presidential and legislative elections just a few days away, the election fever is being felt all the way in the Indonesia Papua New Guinea PNG border region, especially in Kampung Skouw, Muara Tami District, Jayapura City.
The Borderline Ondoafi Tribal Chief of Skouw Wutung, Stanis Tanfa Chilong, who has since become an Indonesian citizen WNI and settled in Kampung Mosso, has ensured all his family members own a KTP self identity card to be able to vote.
Being a long term Indonesian citizen, Stanis, who conducts bintara coaching and ensures public order Babinkamtibmas security in Mosso village Nurdin Makuasang, knows Indonesia's laws and regulations, and as such, knows the requirements to become an eligible voter.

Need for population survey The RI PNG Border Area in Jayapura City will soon have two polling stations located in Mosso Village Hall and a helipad field in front of the local Pamtas Task Force Tactical Post, where there are some 161 families with an estimated 500 600 people.

Prabowo, accompanied by his running mate, Sandiaga Uno, said his decision was based on data his campaign team had gathered across Indonesia. Today, I, Prabowo Subianto, and Sandiaga Uno declare victory as president and vice president of the Republic of Indonesia for the period 2019 to 2024, the former Army general said during a press conference at his family's residence in South Jakarta. Sandiaga, wearing a dark blue golf shirt, stood beside Prabowo. He seemed uncomfortable and did not make any comments. We declare victory, based on our real count, which suggests a Prabowo Sandiaga win of more than 62 percent, the Great Indonesia Movement Party Gerindra chairman said. The latest victory declaration followed comments Prabowo made in Sandiaga's absence on Wednesday night, when he announced to have won the election by 52 percent of the vote. He reportedly expressed his gratitude to God for his victory by bowing to the ground. On Thursday, he repeated his call on supporters to continue monitoring polling stations and guard the vote counting process. According to a message widely distributed by Prabowo supporters on WhatsApp and social media, a mass gathering to celebrate the pair's victory is scheduled for Friday evening. This is despite quick count data compiled by dozens of pollsters registered with the General Elections Commission KPU , showing that his opponents, Joko Jokowi Widodo and his running mate, Ma'ruf Amin, had won the election by between 54 percent and 56 percent of the vote. However, Prabowo told his supporters to not trust quick count results.

Thank you thank you PM Lee, Jokowi tells the Singaporean prime minister on the phone in a 20 second video published by Detik.com. Separately on Thursday afternoon, Jokowi and Ma'ruf met with the leaders of their coalition partners in Central Jakarta. We all know that the quick count is based on a scientific calculation, which during the last election, in 2014 , was 99 percent accurate, Jokowi told media representatives after the meeting.

The police detained activist and university lecturer Robertus Robet on Thursday 07 03 and charged him with defaming the Indonesian military, or TNI, during a human rights protest in Jakarta a case that revives memories of repression during Suharto's Orde Baru military dictatorship. Robet, a former student activist during the 1998 Reformasi movement, was accused of defaming the Indonesian military during a speech at Kamisan, a human rights protest held every Thursday in front of the State Palace, last week. In his speech Robet warned against the prospect of bringing back military men into civilian roles as proposed by several aides of President Joko Jokowi Widodo in the past few months. Civil liberty advocates have been raging against the plan. Robet's attorney Yati Andriyani said in a statement on Thursday that a return of the military's dwifungsi dual function when ABRI, as the TNI was called under Suharto, held government offices and had representations in the parliament, as well as played no small part in repressing civil liberty is something to be feared. At the beginning of his speech, Robet sang a parody of the ABRI anthem, a song that was popular with student activists during Reformasi. Later, a video clip showing him singing the song but with the rest of his speech cut out, was circulated on social media. Robet released a video of his own to explain the background to his action but it did not stop the police from knocking on his door early this morning to bring him to the National Police headquarters in Central Jakarta for questioning. Police have since charged Robet with propagating hate, a crime punishable by up to two years in jail under the country's draconian electronic information and transaction ITE law. He has also been charged with defaming a government institution, punishable by up to 1.5 years in jail under the 1946 Criminal Code. Amnesty International Indonesia, which names Robet as one of its co founders, said the case was another example of deteriorating freedom of speech under President Jokowi's administration. The police should be protecting Robet's right to express his opinion, to criticize the TNI in a peaceful way, rather than arresting him and charging him with a crime, Usman Hamid, Amnesty International Indonesia's executive director, said in a statement on Thursday. The police must release Robet immediately and unconditionally, and protect Robet and his family from all threats, Usman said. Police spokesman Brig. Gen Dedi Prasetyo said Robet would be allowed to leave after he was questioned even if he faces criminal charges because the charges likely to be put against him carry jail time of less than two years. Robet's legal representative Yati said the police had acted in violation of a 2006 Constitutional Court ruling which decreed that defaming a government institution was no longer a punishable crime. Robet's arrest is the latest in a long list of questionable applications of the ITE law. The draconian law was issued under the administration of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono an ex army general, originally to provide legal basis for electronic transactions. But the government at the time included in the law controversial clauses on defamation, hate speech and pornography a loophole that has since been used mostly by people in positions of authority to silence their opponents. Last year, primary school teacher Baiq Nuril was sent to jail for sharing a recording of verbal sexual abuse by the headmaster of her school. The headmaster walked away scot free because Indonesian law has yet to recognize verbal sexual abuse as a crime. Baiq is now waiting in jail while she appeals for the Supreme Court to overturn her sentence. Politicians from opposition parties have also felt the brunt of the law. Rock star cum politician Ahmad Dhani is facing a trial for calling his political opponents idiots on social media. Dhani is a long time supporter of presidential nominee Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo's running mate Sandiaga Uno has called for a revision of the law and promised to make it a priority if he and Prabowo are elected for office in April.

Even their right to vote is in question and their right to work is under threat. The path to mental health reform is a long one, but it is not over yet. Disability rights advocate Yeni Rosa Damayanti knows this more than anybody. She has been pushing for mental health reform for decades. Composed, soft spoken and friendly, Yeni has worked extensively, not just in the mental health sector, but across the entire disability rights movement. She is the chairperson of the Indonesia Mental Health Association and a member of Transforming Communities for Inclusion of Persons With Psychosocial Disabilities TCI Asia Pacific an alliance of people with psychosocial disabilities and their supporters. Speaking to the Jakarta Globe, Yeni recounted how when she began campaigning even other disability advocates didn t acknowledge mental health disabilities as being within the disability rights movement in Indonesia. We had no voice, she said. Yeni Rosa Damayanti is a long time campaigner for mental health reform in Indonesia. Photo courtesy of Andrea Star Reese HRW In 2016, Indonesia passed a mental health reform in the wake of New York based Human Rights Watch s landmark Living in Hell report on pasung the practise of shackling persons with psychosocial disabilities the modern term to describe mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar, schizophrenia and catatonia. While it has been banned since 1977, shackling remains a widespread response to mental illness in Indonesia. Kriti Sharma, Human Rights Watch s senior researcher on disability in Asia, and author of the above report, said it gained a lot of traction in the media. We got a strong reaction from the government, she said. Officials recognised the practise was horrific. The Situation Today A lot of work has been done to release the estimated 57,000 people in chains across Indonesia. Combined efforts have brought the number of annual new cases down from 18,800 in 2014 to 12,800 in 2018. However, the issue has always been about more than just shackling. The government knows this. In 78 percent of cases, shackling is a last resort for families who do not know how to care for a relative with a psychosocial disability. Sharma credits this drop in new shackling cases to the Healthy Indonesia Program With Family Approach. While the program, launched in late 2016, covers all areas of healthcare, the inclusion of basic mental health services has given families treatment options beyond shackling relatives in cages or sheds, or committing them to a mental health institution. According to Sharma, it was a step in the right direction, a movement toward long term sustainability. If people are given support, they can live productive lives, she said. The program has seen many successes. However, as of July 2018, the program has only reached 21.5 million households across Indonesia, or about one in every four. Across the board, Indonesians suffering from psychosocial disablities often still lack access to medical treatments. Only one percent of Indonesia s annual budget is allocated to treating mental health a low figure in a country where an estimated one million people have psychosis. Indonesia has 773 psychiatrists for a population of 260 million that is, one in every 323,000, compared to the American Psychiatric Association s recommended minimum ratio of one psychiatrist per 10,000 people. Yeni put it like this the problem is the approach. In parts of Indonesia, she said, mental health care is limited to only giving them medication or taking them to a mental hospital. And the medication given to the patients is often out of date and no longer effective. According to Yeni, in some areas hospitals still dispence old medications used in the 1950s, with severe side effects. Unfortunately, Indonesia s decentralised system means in many areas, medical services are not distributed evenly. If someone cannot get help at a community level, the next step is to go to the district health services in the district capital. This often presents a problem because, as Yeni pointed out, in many places those services are on a different island. Shackling often happens because families feel they are running out of options and do not know what else to do. A 2013 survey by the Health Ministry said 17 percent of Indonesians have at least a minor disability. About 19 million Indonesians, or 6 percent of the population, live with a mental emotional disorder or mental health condition. This is likely an underrepresentation, according to Human Rights Watch, since the numbers came from a self reporting survey and did not include children under 15 years. Yeni has campaigned for better treatment of Indonesians with psychosocial disabilities since the late 2000s, long before Human Rights Watch even began their research. Her journey started in a support group for people with mental illness. She only became an advocate when she realized groups like that, even when organized together, are not big or powerful enough politically to effect real change. Now after a decade, Yeni and her colleagues are front and centre in the disability rights movement. She even spoke at a United Nations conference on mental disabilities in Geneva in May 2018. Right to Vote Yeni's current focus on securing voting rights for people kept in mental health institutions has led to backlash from conservatives. It s a contentious issue. Indonesia s Constitutional Court only decided to uphold the right of people with mental disabilities to vote in late 2016. And that only after what Yeni described as a hard fought battle. Disability rights activists argue that taking away the right to vote from people with psychosocial disabilities is unconstitutional. And as Yeni said, whenever a regulation is against the law, we protest. The country's legislative council DPR followed the Constitutional Court's move in November last year, passing its own resolution to grant those with mental disabilities the right to vote. Ace Hasan, deputy chairperman of Commision VIII at the DPR which tackles religious, social and women's empowerment issues said that every Indonesian has the right to vote. The Jakarta General Elections Commission KPU Jakarta started registering voters and everything was all nice and dandy, Yeni said. However, grumblings were heard in some quarters. Yeni said there were accusations that allowing people with psychosocial disabilities to vote was a desperate attempt to tarnish the fairness of the election. In January, it was reported that presidential challenger Prabowo Subianto was threatening to pull his nomination over the issue due to the possibility of voter fraud. By then the damage had already been done. The perceived outrage of political leaders can hold of a lot of sway and, in the age of social media, opinions can be devastating. Social media is hard to control. It's so full of people making jokes and ridiculing us, Yeni said. We still have a lot of problems with the public that doesn't understand us . Stigma is still a huge issue, and according to a 2003 report by the World Health organisation, is one of the biggest reasons people are reluctant to seek treatment. Political correctness can be triggered from above, Yeni says. Political leaders must stop using disability as a game. People with mental illness are part of the community. Kriti Sharma authored Human Rights Watch's landmark 2016 report on shackling. Photo courtesy of ABC News Australia Right to Work If disability is a game, then it is not just played by politicians. Psychiatrists, who hold sway over the lives of people with psychosocial disabilities, should be at the spearhead of the campaign to improve treatment for people with mental disabiilities. The real power has always been with the psychiatrists, Yeni said. But that hasn't always been the case. Though regulation has become stricter ten years ago it was not that strong, Yeni said Indonesia is one of the few countries where people can still be interned in psychiatric institutions without their consent. Sharma had similar misgivings It s still relatively easy to admit someone against their will. Once their family leaves them there they cannot get out. Now, people with mental disabilities need a psychiatrist to sign off on their right to work. In almost every office, you have to pass this so called 'psikotes 'psycho test' ,' Yeni said. This ingrained system, acording to her, is blatant discrimination. The worst thing about it This isn t some archaic regulation from the past, it's a new workplace regulation. Fifteen years ago a psikotes was not necessary, but now, no matter how talented you are, if you have psychosocial disability, you are not permitted to work, Yeni said. It is sad to see that they give you pills to keep you alive, but exclude you from life, she said. In her speech to the UN in Geneva, Yeni told the story of how a director of a government care facility was particularly unhappy with the Constitutional Court's decision to give people with mental disabilities the right to vote. The director, who Yeni confirmed to the Jakarta Globe as the director of the Panti Sosial Bina Laras facility in West Jakarta, detested that hundreds of people with psychosocial disability in her facility were given the right to vote, Yeni told the UN forum. Only 62 out of 849 patients in the facility were declared eligible to vote in the Jakarta gubernatorial election in April 2017. This was within current regional laws, but Yeni believes they are unconstitutional. As she pointed out, the Indonesian election law does not recognize limitations on voter's eligibility. It's not limited. There are no requirements to vote , Yeni said. In August last year, KPU Jakarta began registering voters with psychosocial disabilities for the 2019 general election. As part of this process, psychiatrists were given tours of several mental health facilities across Jakarta. The result 1800 out of 2500 patients interviewed by the psychiatrists were struck off the voting roll. Crossed out. Dropped, Yeni said. To her, this was a betrayal. As she told the UN forum in Geneva, They were robbed. Their rights to vote were taken away. They were treated as second class citizens, like they have always been. Yeni let out a big sigh as she admitted I m becoming quite bitter. Looking to the Future There might be light at the end of the tunnel. Steps are being taken. They re working on it, Yeni said. Indonesia launched a mandatory national health insurance system in 2014 and aims to ensure the coverage including mental health care is available to 247 million Indonesians by this year. The Healthy Indonesia program, which Kriti Sharma credited with helping tackling the shackling problem, continues to be expanded. At a public seminar in Jakarta on Dec. 3 last year the International Day of Disabled Persons Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly promised that a government effort would be implemented and a cross ministerial taskforce appointed to look into human rights violations in mental health institutions. Will this be enough The onus is on the government, Yeni said. It's the responsibility of the government to make sure it's enough , Yeni said.

The real power has always been with the psychiatrists, Yeni said.
Though regulation has become stricter ten years ago it was not that strong, Yeni said Indonesia is one of the few countries where people can still be interned in psychiatric institutions without their consent.
Now, people with mental disabilities need a psychiatrist to sign off on their right to work.
Fifteen years ago a psikotes was not necessary, but now, no matter how talented you are, if you have psychosocial disability, you are not permitted to work, Yeni said.
In her speech to the UN in Geneva, Yeni told the story of how a director of a government care facility was particularly unhappy with the Constitutional Court's decision to give people with mental disabilities the right to vote.
The director, who Yeni confirmed to the Jakarta Globe as the director of the Panti Sosial Bina Laras facility in West Jakarta, detested that hundreds of people with psychosocial disability in her facility were given the right to vote, Yeni told the UN forum.
There are no requirements to vote , Yeni said.
In August last year, KPU Jakarta began registering voters with psychosocial disabilities for the 2019 general election.
As part of this process, psychiatrists were given tours of several mental health facilities across Jakarta.
They re working on it, Yeni said.
Indonesia launched a mandatory national health insurance system in 2014 and aims to ensure the coverage including mental health care is available to 247 million Indonesians by this year.
The Healthy Indonesia program, which Kriti Sharma credited with helping tackling the shackling problem, continues to be expanded.
At a public seminar in Jakarta on Dec. 3 last year the International Day of Disabled Persons Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly promised that a government effort would be implemented and a cross ministerial taskforce appointed to look into human rights violations in mental health institutions.
Will this be enough The onus is on the government, Yeni said.
It's the responsibility of the government to make sure it's enough , Yeni said.

That night six generals and a lieutenant were murdered in Jakarta, allegedly by members of the Communist Party PKI . A dreadful bloodletting followed with an estimated half million real or suspected party members slaughtered. The upheaval felled founding President Soekarno and propelled General Soeharto into the Presidential Palace where he stayed for 32 years wielding absolute power by crushing all opposition. He also ruled through patronage, giving army cronies ambassadorships, company directorships, governorships and other perks. At one stage 75 seats of the Parliament s then 360 were held by appointed members of the military. The Dwifungsi two functions policy entrenched the armed forces role in society, even giving low ranks the right to barge through queues and demand instant service. Soeharto quit in 1998 after student protests against his rule and corruption. Indonesia then went through its version of the Arab Spring, introducing democracy, direct election of the President, and freeing the press. The police became a separate civilian department charged with maintaining internal order. Previously it had been a branch of the army. There are now around 500,000 men and a few women in the armed forces, plus 400,000 reservists. The police also have about half a million. Conscription is in the law but volunteers easily fill the ranks. Before Reformasi the military saw itself as the exclusive custodian of the nation s values, which it determined. Remnants of that age refuse to accept the world has spun into a new orbit and their place is the barracks. Key among them is the paranoid former Armed Forces Commander, General Gatot Nurmantyo. He reckons Indonesia is threatened by proxy wars involving foreign states, particularly the US and Australia. In his nightmare the allies are planning to invade West Papua. He reasons that s why marines are rotated through Darwin under the 2014 Force Posture Agreement. Nurmantyo is also notorious for reportedly saying Our Indonesia s democracy at the moment is populist and led by forces through means of a vote. The many are not necessarily right. In 2017 he suspended all military cooperation with Australia. His action, which appears to have been unilateral, came after a hyper nationalist officer training at the Australian Special Forces base in Perth claimed lecturers were insulting the Republic. The scrub fire had to be hosed down at ministerial level. Before Nurmantyo, 58, retired last year he was being tipped as a candidate for the presidency. That didn t happen but he continues to get coverage with weird statements about conspiracies and returning Reds. They re not under beds the masses use mattresses on the floor , so they re plotting in unnamed restaurants and dark rooms. He s backing another former general, Prabowo Subianto who s standing against incumbent Joko Jokowi Widodo the official commander in chief has no military background. The book seizings appear to be illegal in 2010 the Constitutional Court overthrew the censorship laws of Soeharto s New Order government. The raids have only been condemned by civil rights groups and individuals brave enough to shrug off charges that they re fellow travelers. Widodo, who has also joined the chorus of vigilantes, has been silent. The print enemies sought by soldiers are few and hard to find. Occasionally there s a wrinkled translation of Karl Marx, plus some speculative tracts by pseudonymous scribes. The most credible alternatives to the army s version of history are coming from overseas scholars, written in English and rarely seen. Last year Australian academic Dr Jess Melvin published her research founded on original army documents. Not for her the excuse that the massacres were spontaneous uprisings of pious Muslims outraged by godless Marxists. The conclusions in her book The Army and the Indonesian Genocide are definitive The military organised the mass killings and supplied the weapons. Soldiers arrested suspects and then gave them to armed mobs to torture and murder. The devil makes work for idle hands the army now has little to do other than chase armed separatists in West Papua and help out in natural disasters these strike regularly and brutally through earthquakes, tsunamis, landslips and floods. A few officers go overseas on peacekeeping, but the rest tend to be perpetually exercising ready for the threats. This month the respected newsweekly Tempo reported that the military wants changes to a 2004 law restricting retired officers to positions in a limited number of ministries and civil institutions. Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto was reported saying about 500 middle and high ranking officers heading for pensions wanted to get involved in civilian life.

Indonesian elections On April 17 more than 190 million registered Indonesian voters will go to the polls for presidential and general elections. Favoured incumbent President Joko Widodo is being challenged by former military general Prabowo Subianto. Subianto is also the son in law of long time former President Suharto who led Indonesia for three decades. Southeast Asia analyst Damien Kingsbury said both candidates have adopted nationalist sentiments in their campaign so far. There are both populists that are operating on a populist agenda, he said. Jokowi is trying to broaden his appeal out to the middle ground of Indonesian voters. Prabowo is appealing much more to a base. Professor Kingsbury said despite making up some recent ground, Subianto is well behind President Widodo in most polling. The polls have been showing that Jokowi is running at around the 50 percent mark in terms of popularity, he said. Prabowo is running at around the 30 percent mark with a significant number of undecided voters. This is the second time the two rivals will face off after President Widodo defeated Subianto in elections five years ago. According to the West Papua National Committee, hundreds of thousands of West Papuans boycotted those elections in 2014. West Papuan militants back boycott Indonesia s control of West Papua has long been a flash point for ongoing low level conflict between Indonesian forces and Indigenous Papuan militants. Indonesia recently deployed 600 soldiers to protect the building of a major highway in West Papua, in response to the killings of 19 Indonesian road workers. The road project was a signature promise that President Joko Widodo made to the region. In following clashes with militants, Indonesia s military said three of its soldiers were killed along with up to 10 rebels. But despite this escalation, Professor Kingsbury said West Papua had essentially been a non issue in the election campaign. Both candidates believe that that Melanesian West Papuans should accept they are Indonesian. he said. They believe the separatist movement in West Papua is essentially a criminal organisation.

Police said an Indonesian woman with affiliations to the Islamic State had detonated at least two home made bombs in Sibolga, North Sumatra, early on Wednesday morning 13 03 , killing herself and two of her children. The incident happened at the tail end of a massive police operation that had netted three terror suspects and 300 kilograms of explosives. The explosives were seized in the coastal town an eight hour drive south from the provincial capital Medan on Tuesday. Police have been on the hunt for terrorist networks across the country to prevent them from attacking officers and public facilities, with just over a month left before Indonesia holds a presidential election. The scattered body parts of the Sibolga female bomber who appeared to be in her 30s were found inside her home, Brig. Gen. Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta. On Tuesday afternoon, the police's anti terror unit Densus 88 had arrested the woman's husband, Husain, aka Abu Hamzah, a suspected terrorist who has been affiliated with the Islamic State network in Indonesia. Husain was also arrested in Sibolga. Police had then gone on to Husain's home, where his wife and two of the couple s children, both under five years old, were hiding. According to the police, Husain's wife threw a bomb at officers as they rushed her home. One police officer and a neighbor were injured by the blast. The police spent the next 10 hours negotiating with Husain's wife, trying to persuade her to surrender. Husain had tried to help convince his wife to give herself up to no avail, Dedi said. Around an hour after midnight, the woman blew up two more bombs. The second bomb killed her and the two children, the police suspected. Police have so far recovered body parts from two individuals, a female adult and a two year old.

The police s bomb squad Gegana, including a robot unit, has been deployed to the house to find and defuse more bombs. Dozens of houses in the area have been damaged. The bombs used low explosives, but the impact was significant, Dedi said. Husain said he had assembled dozens of bombs. His wife had four of them, as well as dozens of kilograms of potassium that can be used as explosives, Dedi said.

Kadin members who attended the event included former chairman Aburizal Bakrie and James T. Riady, Kadin's deputy chairman for education, healthcare and employment affairs. Rosan said businesses should stay away from spreading hoaxes and fake news on social media. Instead, Kadin members should actively try to create peace.

The pig nosed turtle which has a distinctive snout like nose and webbed feet is only found in Australia and New Guinea, an island shared between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and is protected under Indonesian conservation laws. Some turtle species are popular in China and elsewhere in Asia as food or for use in traditional medicine. In 2014, Indonesian officials rescued more than 8,000 baby pig nosed turtles hidden in suitcases and thought to be destined for China and Singapore. This year, smugglers were arrested in neighbouring Malaysia with some 3,300 endangered turtles aboard their boat. Indonesia, an archipelago of some 17,000 islands, is home to a kaleidoscope of exotic animals and plants, but the illegal trade in wildlife is rampant and laws aimed at providing protection are often poorly enforced.

Antara Photo Syaiful Arif Jakarta. Routine police traffic stops are nothing but uneventful in Indonesia. Unfortunate drivers are usually fined, or find themselves under pressure to pay small bribes to officers, while fellow road users are annoyed and frustrated by the inevitable traffic disruptions that result. At most, there may be some random traffic offender throwing a tantrum, which could go viral on social media for a day or two. But last week, one such checkpoint in Central Java saw the arrest of a high profile terrorist operative, which might just spare the country yet another terror attack. Triyono Wagimin Atmo, who operated under the aliases Andalus and Abu Hilwa, was arrested by local police during a regular traffic inspection in Temanggung on Feb. 14, National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Dedi Prasetyo announced on Thursday last week. Traffic police were alerted when Triyono left his car and fled into a nearby rice paddy just before he reached a traffic checkpoint. Some officers gave pursuit while others examined his car, where they found propaganda materials that revealed his identity. Dedi said Densus 88, the National Police's elite counterterrorism unit, had been on Triyono's trail for some time, which had likely put him on edge. He is a member of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, the Islamic State affiliated terror group behind the 2018 Surabaya suicide attacks. Dedi said the 32 year old native of Karanganyar, Central Java, had been planning an attack on police in Yogyakarta. The person concerned Triyono is linked with the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippines because he had undergone paramilitary training there, Dedi said. He added that Triyono and his group were planning to conduct amaliyah an Arabic word for operation, widely used by members of Islamic terror groups in Southeast Asia to refer to attacks on the authorities. Their targets included police stations in Central Java and Yogyakarta. The arrest cannot be underestimated. We are now in the process of conducting a follow up investigation. Based on his confession, three people were helping him to plan the attack, Dedi said. Densus 88 is still tracking down the three other suspected terrorists, who allegedly also attempted to steal weapons from the police. The unit is also cooperating with the Yogyakarta Police's counterterrorism and anti radicalism task force to monitor Abu Sayyaf's movements to thwart their plans. Triyono and convicted weapons smuggler Adi Jihadi are known to have traveled to the southern Philippine province of Basilan in June 2016 to participate in paramilitary training. The two also received paramilitary training in the Karang Bolong area of Anyer, West Java, from alleged terrorist Nanang Kosim, who was killed in a shootout with Densus 88 in March 2017. Nanang was known as a weapons expert and involved in the 2016 attack in Thamrin, Central Jakarta.

Indonesians are casting votes not only for president but about 20,500 other candidates standing for the Senate and legislatures at the national, provincial and district levels. Election officials are providing more than 1.6 million bottles of halal certified indelible ink for voters to dip a finger in after casting ballots at some 810,000 polling stations. The Election Commission estimates more than 17 million people are involved in ensuring the elections run smoothly, including volunteers, guards and registered witnesses for every polling station.

AP Photo Binsar Bakkara DEMOCRATIC OUTPOST After three decades of military rule ended in 1998, Indonesia has become the most robust democracy in Southeast Asia, a region where authoritarian governments and stage managed elections are the norm. But despite being the world's most populous Muslim nation, the third largest democracy and a member of the Group of 20 major economies, Indonesia has a low profile on the world stage. That is slowly changing, with the country recently becoming a non permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, announcing a bid to host the 2032 Olympics and analysts forecasting its economy to be among the world's five largest by 2030. CAMPAIGN ISSUES The presidential contenders are stark contrasts in background and personality. The slightly nerdy Widodo is admired for his friendly, down to earth manner. Subianto, from a wealthy family, is prone to explosions of anger and has an emotional, tub thumping style of campaigning. Both are nationalists and Muslims, though Subianto's nationalism sits at the extreme end of the spectrum. Subianto's campaign has been negative and fear based, emphasizing what he sees as Indonesia's current dire situation and the risk of exploitation by foreign powers or disintegration. Widodo, the front runner in all credible polls, has emphasized his government's efforts to improve infrastructure and reduce poverty, and can show progress in both areas.

Quit calling people kafir, an Arabic word for infidels or nonbelievers. This proclamation was issued by Nahdlatul Ulama or NU, an Indonesian collective claiming more than 90 million adherents from clerics and politicians to shopkeepers and farmers. One of the group s core tenets is promoting a more tolerant brand of Sunni Islam. Its leaders aim to uphold a secular state. They preach coexistence with Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and Shia Muslims. And the word kafir, NU says, undermines that mission with theological violence. When someone calls you a kafir, that means you re considered someone who is godless, said Alex Arifianto, an Indonesian political scientist with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. The largest Muslim organization in the world is saying, Look, we have to treat non Muslims as equals. Alex Arifianto, political scientist, S.

The largest Muslim organization in the world is saying, Look, we have to treat non Muslims as equals. The group is hardly progressive by American or European standards its leaders views on sex, family and piety are conservative but NU does define itself in opposition to hyperorthodox Islam. Its leaders believe their teachings are an antidote to fundamentalism, exemplified by the Wahhabism theology exported by Saudi Arabia. In one of NU s promotional films, a cleric intones that genuine Islam has been supplanted by a coarse, cruel and savage Islam. I am absolutely certain that our understanding of Islam is shared by the majority of Muslims worldwide. Islamic extremism is a ghoulish nightmare that keeps the world awake at night, trembling in horror. NU cleric from a promotional film Islamic extremism, the cleric continues, is a ghoulish nightmare that keeps the world awake at night, trembling in horror. Related Not all mosques welcome in Indonesia, world s most populous Muslim majority country If the NU sounds testy, it s because some of its leaders feel overlooked, he says. The global conversation around Islam is dominated by talk of militants, such as ISIS or Hezbollah, or hard line Islamist networks such as the Muslim Brotherhood. This exasperates NU. Not only is it vastly larger than all of these groups combined, but it s also older. It was formed in 1926, two years before the Muslim Brotherhood and even then, it was calling itself an alternative to puritanical Islam. The organization wants to disseminate the message of Islam as a source of universal love. The organization craves a larger impact on the world. It has even set up a Western nonprofit wing, based in North Carolina, to disseminate the message of Islam as a source of universal love. But this dream isn t very compatible with NU s intense, Indonesian nationalism a sentiment unlikely to entice anyone outside of the country. Islam may have arrived in what is now Indonesia as early as a millennium ago via Muslim sailors, who managed to convert a few island societies. The faith began to sweep across the entire island chain in the 1500s and, today, roughly 9 in 10 Indonesians are Muslim. But Islamic practices have melded with Indigenous rituals and customs informed by Hinduism and Buddhism, which long predate the arrival of Islam. NU was founded, in part, to resist the fundamentalist urge to scrub down their complex identity into something seen as more literalist and pure. They re still standing up to conservative, hard line Muslims, Arifianto said. They re saying, Your theology is out of date compared to contemporary society, which is ethnically and religiously diverse. Instead of calling people kafir, the organization says, Muslims should call nonbelievers muwathin. This is an Arabic word for citizen, but it s not very well known in Indonesia. The timing of this anti kafir push is hardly accidental. The timing of this anti kafir push is hardly accidental. Indonesia is gearing up for a high stakes general election one in which mainstream Indonesian Islam, epitomized by NU, will be challenged by fundamentalism. In the 21st century, Indonesia has seen the rise of hard line groups from vigilante mobs to Wahhabi purists. Ironically, Arifianto attributes this phenomenon to the country s increased progress and prosperity. Now, for the first time, you have more middle class people who are educated and reading the Quran on their own, he said. Expansions in higher education and literacy have turned more Muslims into free agents. They re going on the internet where conservative clerics tend to dominate.

That was the year hundreds of thousands of protesters amassed in the capital, Jakarta, to target the then governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who goes by Ahok. They condemned Ahok, a Christian with Chinese ethnicity, as a kafir unfit to rule Muslims. Not only did he lose the ensuing election, but Indonesian courts, amid pressure from street movements, charged him with blaspheming Islam all over a speech in which he contends the Quran does not forbid non Muslims from leading Muslims. That got him locked up. His two year prison sentence ended just weeks ago.

The ceremony was attended by a host of dignitaries, including Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu. KRI Alugoro is the first ever submarine to be assembled locally at the PT PAL shipyard in Surabaya. Not every country can produce submarines, Ryacudu said in his remarks. In the ASEAN region, only Indonesia has been able to do so. We can already make them. The defense minister added that the new submarine features some of the latest undersea warfare technologies. He also expressed his hopes that Indonesia will be able to export submarines in the future. The submarine was originally scheduled for launch in October 2018. However, the SSK had to be moved to an alternative launch site following the discovery that the original location has become too shallow for the submarine owing to sedimentary deposits, IHS Jane s reported in March. Indonesia and South Korea signed a 1.1 billion contract for three Nagapasa class SSKs in December 2011 as part of the Indonesian Ministry of Defense s 2024 Defense Strategic Plan, which calls for the procurement of at least 10 SSKs for the Indonesian Navy. The first two SSKs of the class were built by South Korean defense contractor Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering DSME , while the third boat was assembled with the support of South Korean engineers as part of a technology transfer program. PT PAL received the different submarine modules from South Korea in December 2016 and subsequently began the assembling process. The first of class SSK, KRI Nagapasa 403 , was commissioned in August 2017 in South Korea and is now homeported at the Palu Naval Base in the Watusampu province of Central Sulawesi.

The 1,400 ton SSK class has an operational range of around 11,000 nautical miles and has an endurance of about 50 days. The sub is a multipurpose platform capable of conducting anti surface warfare, anti submarine warfare, and special forces missions. The SSK can be armed with heavyweight torpedoes, anti ship missiles, and mines. According to Indonesian naval planners, the Navy needs at least 12 operational submarines to fulfill its core mission of protecting Indonesian territorial waters.

A high ranking officer in Indonesia's military has downplayed rumors that some powerful political figures might try to challenge the outcome of the April 17 elections when 190 million voters will choose a president, vice president and members of the state and regional legislatures if the results do not go their way. Lt. Gen. Joni Supriyanto, the newly appointed chief of the general staff of the Indonesian Military TNI , told the Jakarta Globe on Friday that there has never been a case in the country's history when the people did not recognize the results of an election. The people of Indonesia are much smarter nowadays, more modern, but they are also more patriotic, Joni, who previously served as chief of the TNI's Jakarta Command, said in an interview at the military headquarters in Cilangkap, East Jakarta. The three star general said he believes Indonesians have grown mature enough in democracy. And who has ever challenged the Constitutional Court's rulings he added. By law, any electoral disputes can be brought before the Constitutional Court. In the 2014 presidential election, the losing presidential nominee Prabowo Subianto who is running again this year initially refused to concede defeat to Joko Jokowi Widodo. Instead, his campaign team filed a string of election dispute cases in the Constitutional Court. The impasse lasted for nearly three months until just three days before the presidential inauguration on Oct. 20, 2014, when Prabowo held a 20 minute meeting with Jokowi at the house of Prabowo's father, the late New Order economic architect Soemitro Djojohadikusumo, on Jalan Kertanegara in South Jakarta, to concede the election and congratulate the then newly appointed president. Polarization and Identity Politics Polarization between the Jokowi and Prabowo camps during the election campaign has been so strong that people draw parallels between it and the 2016 Jakarta gubernatorial election, one of the most divisive ever. The popular Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, backed by the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle PDI P , which also backs Jokowi, was defeated through clever manipulation of identity politics by his opponents, including the infamous charge against him that he had committed blasphemy against Islam. Ahok was not just defeated in the election, he was also sentenced to jail for two years after he was convicted of blasphemy. As political tension heats up again in the world's third largest democracy, the spotlight is on the General Elections Commission KPU and Election Supervisory Board Bawaslu . Apart from their respective roles of election organizer and election watchdog, they must also deal with criticism from powerful figures in the country who cast doubt on their neutrality. The KPU has done well, said Joni, who assumed his new position on Jan. 25. He applauded the KPU's efforts to devise a campaign schedule that cleverly prevents the supporters of Prabowo and Jokowi from meeting on the streets, and thus avoid violent clashes. Joni, who previously also served as special staff for the Army Chief of Staff, said the potential for clashes between the two supporter camps in Jakarta is very real, but so far, the KPU has done a sterling job in minimizing it. People Power Joni said the threat by senior opposition leader Amien Rais to launch a people power protest at the slightest hint of voter fraud during the presidential election rather than appealing to the Constitutional Court was an empty one. The former speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly MPR had wanted to draw similarities between his threat of people power now with the real people power of 1998 that managed to topple the authoritarian New Order regime of President Suharto. Joni, who also served as deputy head of the TNI's Strategic Intelligence Agency BAIS , said unlike in 1998, the economy is in good shape and people can express their political aspirations in free elections. People are free in politics, he added. Nevertheless, he said the TNI has made preparations for the worst that can happen in the aftermath of the elections. We have prepared detailed contingency plans, for anything that could happen, including worst case scenarios. Chief Security Minister Wiranto said in March that more than 453,000 members of the police and military would be deployed to secure the elections.

Please ask the government. Why do you ask me If I were the Indonesian president, I would be responsible for it, he told thousands of his supporters attending his campaign. Subianto then conveyed his pledge that he would resolve the state fund leak if he were elected as the Indonesian president. As part of his strategies in combating corruption, he would raise the salaries of law enforcers, including judges, prosecutors, as well as police and military personnel. The salaries of our judges need to be significantly increased because they should not be bribed. The judges are the last resort for our people to complain.

Earlier this year, Robet sang the song again to show his opposition to President Joko Widodo's decision to allow active military officers to take jobs in government ministries. He was duly arrested. No one was offended when I sang the song before, Robet told Al Jazeera. I said in my speech I have nothing against the plan. Yes, they can get jobs in the administration , but first, they have to retire. The Indonesian military, commonly known by the acronym TNI Tentara Nasional Indonesia , was forced to reform after the fall of Soeharto, losing the seats it held in the national parliament during the authoritarian's 32 years in power. It also had to give up its dual role to defend the country, but also to enmesh itself in political life across the archipelago. Banned formally from politics since 2004, neither the soldiers nor the police are allowed to vote. But even with the legal restrictions, the generals remain a powerful force. Joko Widodo, the former mayor of Solo who became president in 2014, was the first Indonesian leader to come from outside the traditional elite. While he pitched himself as a democrat reformist, he has come increasingly close to the military. He has built up a personal network of trusted officers who had worked with him since early in his political career, Antonius Made Tony Supriatma, a visiting fellow in the Indonesian Studies Programme at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, wrote in a paper. No doubt, despite the military being banned from politics, Jokowi Widodo knows full well that the armed forces are still the most important political player in Indonesia. Confidantes Two of Widodo's most trusted advisers are former generals. Luhut Binsar Panjaitan served in the country's special forces for more than 20 years, while AM Hendropriyono was also in the special forces and headed the intelligence agency in 2004 when Indonesia's most prominent human rights activist Munir was killed. The administration of Widodo's predecessor said Hendropriyono had no connection with the death of Munir, who was poisoned with arsenic on a flight to Europe. Both men's sons in law have also enjoyed a rapid rise up the ranks during Widodo's time in office. The president also appointed former Army Chief Wiranto to his administration in 2016, giving him the job of Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Minister. Wiranto was indicted by the United Nations for crimes against humanity relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote. He has denied wrongdoing. Try Sutrisno, meanwhile, who was Soeharto's vice president and was also accused of abuses in East Timor, has endorsed Widodo for a second term. Our society is stumbling when it comes to spelling out the narrative of civilian and military, said Puri Kencana Putri, a human rights activist who works on military and human rights issues. We have failed to guard the reform agenda, including to revoke the 'dual function' of the military. Over the past few years, Widodo has sought to address the surplus of middle and senior officers caused by the abolition of that dual function. In 2017, about 141 TNI generals and 790 TNI colonels each representing about a fifth of the total had no formal position, according to Supriatma. The proposal to allow 60 to take up jobs in the civilian administration without having to retire, as well as the creation of new units and commands, is part of an effort to address the imbalance. But Evan Laksmana, a senior researcher with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, said the proposal is merely a stop gap that does not resolve the problem of officer promotional logjams. It is a regressive public and military policy, he said. The military has also been getting more involved with the country's development, in the kind of national infrastructure initiatives and village based projects that were a hallmark of the Soeharto era. In its 2018 annual report, the Agrarian Reform Consortium, an NGO, said 41 people were killed, 51 shot and 546 tortured as a result of conflicts over land during Widodo's first term. The report also claimed that the military and police were working with the government and companies. In Nduga, West Papua, thousands have been forced to flee amid a military offensive that followed last December's massacre of construction workers by independence fighters. NGOs on the ground accuse the military of harassing local villagers and destroying houses and churches. The TNI spokesman in Papua earlier this month described the allegations as hoax and said its troops were committed to upholding the Geneva Conventions. He Widodo failed to make the military more professional, said Puri. Widodo's challenger in the April 17 poll, Prabowo Subianto, is also a former general, implicated in the abduction of pro democracy activists in May 1998. Prabowo was a loyalist of Soeharto and former commander of the Army Strategic Command Kostrad and has built a campaign based on nationalism and conservatism, aligning himself with Islamic political parties including the Prosperous Justice Party and the National Mandate Party PAN . PAN is linked to Muhammadiyah, Indonesia's second largest Muslim organisation. Prabowo hopes to capitalise on recent surveys, including Charta Politika and Lembaga Survei Indonesia LSI , that suggest Indonesians now see the TNI is the most trusted institution in the country. Nevertheless, some people are sceptical. The younger generation have begun to care about military history in Indonesia and the impact on their everyday life, said Nisrina Nadhifah Rahman, who works with The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence Kontras . They began to believe that the military had gained more power. Robet's arrest triggered a public outcry. He was charged with online criminal defamation and for insulting an authority or a public institution. Amnesty International Indonesia's Executive Director Usman Hamid said the charges were a blatant attempt to silence criticism. Robet is an academic who is guilty of nothing more than voicing his views over proposals to place senior military officers in positions of power within the government, said Usman. Robet remains undaunted. Jokowi is the leader of a civilian government, said Robet. He must not sacrifice civilian supremacy only for the pragmatic interests of the election.

Earlier this year, Robet sang the song again to show his opposition to President Joko Widodo's decision to allow active military officers to take jobs in government ministries.
The Indonesian military, commonly known by the acronym TNI Tentara Nasional Indonesia , was forced to reform after the fall of Soeharto, losing the seats it held in the national parliament during the authoritarian's 32 years in power.
Joko Widodo, the former mayor of Solo who became president in 2014, was the first Indonesian leader to come from outside the traditional elite.
He has built up a personal network of trusted officers who had worked with him since early in his political career, Antonius Made Tony Supriatma, a visiting fellow in the Indonesian Studies Programme at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, wrote in a paper.
No doubt, despite the military being banned from politics, Jokowi Widodo knows full well that the armed forces are still the most important political player in Indonesia.
Luhut Binsar Panjaitan served in the country's special forces for more than 20 years, while AM Hendropriyono was also in the special forces and headed the intelligence agency in 2004 when Indonesia's most prominent human rights activist Munir was killed.
The administration of Widodo's predecessor said Hendropriyono had no connection with the death of Munir, who was poisoned with arsenic on a flight to Europe.
Try Sutrisno, meanwhile, who was Soeharto's vice president and was also accused of abuses in East Timor, has endorsed Widodo for a second term.
Our society is stumbling when it comes to spelling out the narrative of civilian and military, said Puri Kencana Putri, a human rights activist who works on military and human rights issues.
Over the past few years, Widodo has sought to address the surplus of middle and senior officers caused by the abolition of that dual function.
The proposal to allow 60 to take up jobs in the civilian administration without having to retire, as well as the creation of new units and commands, is part of an effort to address the imbalance.
But Evan Laksmana, a senior researcher with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, said the proposal is merely a stop gap that does not resolve the problem of officer promotional logjams.
In its 2018 annual report, the Agrarian Reform Consortium, an NGO, said 41 people were killed, 51 shot and 546 tortured as a result of conflicts over land during Widodo's first term.
He Widodo failed to make the military more professional, said Puri.
Prabowo was a loyalist of Soeharto and former commander of the Army Strategic Command Kostrad and has built a campaign based on nationalism and conservatism, aligning himself with Islamic political parties including the Prosperous Justice Party and the National Mandate Party PAN .
Prabowo hopes to capitalise on recent surveys, including Charta Politika and Lembaga Survei Indonesia LSI , that suggest Indonesians now see the TNI is the most trusted institution in the country.
The younger generation have begun to care about military history in Indonesia and the impact on their everyday life, said Nisrina Nadhifah Rahman, who works with The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence Kontras .
Robet is an academic who is guilty of nothing more than voicing his views over proposals to place senior military officers in positions of power within the government, said Usman.
Jokowi is the leader of a civilian government, said Robet.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,b'4/12/19 1:33',"[{'Widodo': 1.0}, {'Soeharto': 1.0}, {'Robet': 1.0}]","[{'Indonesia': 1.0}, {'TNI': 1.0}, {'Prabowo': 1.0}]","['Jakarta', 'Indonesia', 'Robet', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'East', 'Timor,', 'Papua', 'Geneva', 'Indonesia']","[{'Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland': (46.2017559, 6.1466014)}, {'East,Kansas,United States': (39.20642825, -96.5991323)}, {'Papua,Papua,Indonesia': (-4.09526895, 136.632615782726)}, {'Indonesia': (-2.49599765, 120.200165645358)}, {'Jakarta,Jakarta,Indonesia': (-6.1875613, 106.8277658)}, {'Timor,': (-9.3460171, 124.637279937916)}]","[(46.2017559, 6.1466014), (39.20642825, -96.5991323), (-4.09526895, 136.632615782726), (-2.49599765, 120.200165645358), (-6.1875613, 106.8277658), (-9.3460171, 124.637279937916)]","[{'Papua,Papua,Indonesia': (-4.09526895, 136.632615782726)}, {'Indonesia': (-2.49599765, 120.200165645358)}, {'Jakarta,Jakarta,Indonesia': (-6.1875613, 106.8277658)}]","[(-4.09526895, 136.632615782726), (-2.49599765, 120.200165645358), (-6.1875613, 106.8277658)]",0,Indonesia

The third debate, on March 17, drew focus to educational, employment, health, as well as social and cultural issues, while the fourth round, covering international and ideological issues, was organized on March 30. The presidential debates, televised live by several TV channels, will enable some 192 million eligible voters to gain a comprehensive understanding of the capacity and capability of the two pairs.

But should President Joko Widodo s election rival, Prabowo Subianto, emerge victorious in April s election, Rizieq Shihab is planning to return to Indonesia, presumably to promote his agenda of intolerance and hatred once more. That s according to the chairman of the Habib Rizieq Shihab HRS Center, Abdul Chair Ramadan, who said that the country s current administration made it difficult for the FPI leader to return to the country unless there was a change of leadership. Rizieq Shihab said that if Prabowo won, he would go home, Abdul said at the Prabowo Sandiaga National Secretariat office in Jakarta yesterday as quoted by Katadata. Abdul, who had previously been running as a member of the Islam based Crescent Star Party PBB but withdrew after PBB recently decided to join Jokowi s coalition, said that the current administration had unjustly criminalized Rizieq as well as numerous other opposition figures such as Ahmad Dhani and Buni Yani using the controversial Law on Information and Electronic Transactions UU ITE . Unlike those other figures, who have already been sentenced for spreading hate speech under UU ITE, Rizieq s legal status is a little more complicated. The FPI head fled the country around the time he was named a suspect in a high profile and highly ironic pornography case involving an alleged affair between him and one of his married followers, a case he claims was engineered to frame him. However, the Jakarta Police officially dropped Rizieq s suspect status in that case in June, alleviating the risk that authorities would be waiting to arrest him at the airport should he return to Indonesia. On the other hand, there are still several other open cases against the FPI head that could potentially move forward, including one accusation regarding his conspiratorial claim that the country s new currency contained hidden communist imagery, a potential violation of laws protecting state symbols. Rizieq was the figurehead at the forefront of the mass protests against Basuki BTP Tjahaja Purnama the former Jakarta governor formerly known as Ahok ahead of the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race, stoking anger over the heavily politicized and trumped up charges that BTP had insulted Islam. The protests proved instrumental in defeating BTP and getting him a 2 year prison sentence for blasphemy. Prabowo went to Mecca to help earn Rizieq s endorsement and promised to allow the FPI leader to safely return to Indonesia should he win. However, Prabowo has done little else to appease him, such as ignoring the running mates recommended by a hardliner cleric council in favor of picking businessman Sandiaga Uno. Nonetheless, Rizieq continues to push for Prabowo s presidency, telling his supporters that if you want LGBT banned and pribumi a controversial term for native Indonesians to be prosperous, they should vote Prabowo Sandiaga.","['Rizieq Shihab', 'Joko Widodo', 'Prabowo Subianto', 'Rizieq Shihab']","['Joko', 'Widodo', 'Rizieq', 'Shihab', 'Rizieq', 'Shihab', 'Abdul', 'Jokowi', 'Ahmad', 'Dhani', 'Buni', 'Yani', 'Rizieq', 'Rizieq', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo']",['the Islamic Defenders Front FPI'],"['Islamic', 'Defenders', 'Front', 'FPI', 'Habib', 'Rizieq', 'Shihab', 'HRS', 'FPI', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Sandiaga', 'National', 'Secretariat', 'Crescent', 'Star', 'Party', 'PBB', 'Electronic', 'Transactions', 'UU', 'ITE', 'FPI', 'FPI', 'Basuki', 'BTP', 'Tjahaja', 'Purnama', 'BTP', 'FPI', 'Sandiaga', 'Uno.', 'Nonetheless,', 'Rizieq', 'Prabowo', 'Sandiaga.']",[],"['Indonesia', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Indonesia']","['Indonesia', 'Jakarta', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Indonesia']","['Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia', 'Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia', 'Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia', 'Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia']","['Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia']",[],"['Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia', 'Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia', 'Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia', 'Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia']","Rizieq Shihab, the leader of Indonesia s most infamous hardliner organization, the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , played a pivotal role in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial race but has had little impact on the 2019 presidential campaign thus far, his influence greatly limited by the fact that he remains in largely self imposed exile in Saudi Arabia.

In reality, Papua, as frequent travelers can attest, has some of the country s most scenic views and unique culture, such as pristine waters and the rich marine diversity of Raja Ampat in West Papua. In an effort to encourage conversation, and to foster recognition of Papua, nonprofit organization EcoNusa launched an initiative called MaCe Papua, highlighting Papuan stories. MaCe short for Mari Cerita Let s Tell a Story comes in the form of a monthly discussion that highlights various topics, from local Papuan languages to culinary adventures. For its initial discussion on Wednesday, EcoNusa brought in homegrown Papuan talents, inviting singer Michael Jakarimilena, author Raden Lukman and activist Lisa Duwiry. Lisa has been active in championing social issues surrounding Papua. One of her first initiatives was to participate in a book drive called Buku Untuk Papua Books for Papua . At first I was a volunteer, and at that time Twitter was abuzz with all sorts of social initiatives, but then I noticed there was next to nothing for the people of Papua, she said. I looked around and I finally found Buku Untuk Papua founder Dayu Rifanto. The book initiative grew over time to include free classes and a crowdfunding drive for a library. After taking a break from the initiative and finding herself still wanting to do something for the Papuan people, Lisa started UntukKorowai after finding a story on Facebook about a Korowai child named Puti Hatil in need of medical assistance. Initially, I went just to help spread the word around, but eventually it got bigger through celebrities and influencers highlighting the issue. We eventually managed to raise around Rp 136 million US 9,697 to pay for a teaching assistant for the village as well as medical supplies. Lisa believes that growth and progress for Papua should not be limited to infrastructure and natural resources, as it should also include the people. The people of Papua are brilliant, and imagine if we can harness that potential. Indonesia will be immensely rich if we can involve Papua more in our development. From the heart Singer Michael Jakarimilena left of Indonesian Idol fame often sings songs about Papua during his shows. Courtesy of EcoNusa Michael, known for his stint in the first season of Indonesian Idol, was born and raised in Jayapura, leaving his hometown to study in Surabaya in 2001 before making it to Jakarta three years later for the singing competition. Throughout his singing career, which has taken him to numerous places, both at home and internationally, Michael often sings songs about Papua and asks his audience whether they have been to Papua as a way to introduce the region. I always say to them, Papua is more beautiful than the stories I tell you . Papuan children, with all of their disadvantages, venture out into the world to gather knowledge and to know their brothers and sisters from across the country. I make a point of saying, If you re Indonesian, visit Papua to get to know your Papuan brothers and sisters , Michael said, describing Papua as Indonesia s paradise on earth . Michael is aware many Papuan children often dream of being either a civil servant for financial stability or a soccer player for the fame and glory. He himself once dreamed of being a player for Persipura, a soccer club based in Jayapura. It is every Papuan boy s dream to play for Persipura, because the club s vision is to bring glory to God and to bring honor to the Papuan people. When you see a player out on the field, you ll see that he doesn t play for himself, but he plays for his family and friends, carrying their hopes and dreams. Meanwhile, Raden, who was born in the Papuan city of Sorong, said that even though his father is from Banten and his mother from Jakarta, he reserved a special place in his heart for Papua. His love for Papua is manifested in his book Ku Kenalkan Papuaku Introducing My Papua , which he wrote to provide a different perspective on Papua for those who have never stepped foot there. Raden, who recently graduated from Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, said he intended to return to Sorong to become a city planner, using his knowledge to improve his hometown. For me, Papua is not only built by material things. What we need is for people to put their hearts into it. I always tell my friends that the sun rises in the east, and because of that, hope also comes from the east. This means that we are people with hope in our hearts, he said. Whenever my Papuan friends say we re not experienced enough, I always reply that what we can offer is the future. ste","['Michael Jakarimilena', 'Raden Lukman', 'Lisa Duwiry']","['Raja', 'Ampat', 'Mari', 'Cerita', 'Michael', 'Jakarimilena,', 'Raden', 'Lukman', 'Lisa', 'Duwiry.', 'Lisa', 'Lisa', 'Puti', 'Hatil', 'Lisa', 'Michael', 'Jakarimilena', 'Michael', 'Michael']","['Mari Cerita Let s Tell a Story', 'Papua', 'EcoNusa', 'EcoNusa']","['West', 'Nusa', 'Tenggara', 'Papua', 'Buku', 'Untuk', 'Papua', 'Books', 'for', 'Papua', 'Papua', 'Papua', 'Papua', 'Gadjah', 'Mada', 'University,', 'Yogyakarta,']",[],"['Indonesia', 'Bali', 'West', 'Papua.', 'US', 'Papua', 'Indonesia', 'Papua', 'Surabaya', 'Jakarta', 'Papua', 'Papua', 'Indonesia', 'Banten', 'Sorong']",[],"[' For its initial discussion on Wednesday, EcoNusa brought in homegrown Papuan talents, inviting singer Michael Jakarimilena, author Raden Lukman and activist Lisa Duwiry', ' For its initial discussion on Wednesday, EcoNusa brought in homegrown Papuan talents, inviting singer Michael Jakarimilena, author Raden Lukman and activist Lisa Duwiry', ' For its initial discussion on Wednesday, EcoNusa brought in homegrown Papuan talents, inviting singer Michael Jakarimilena, author Raden Lukman and activist Lisa Duwiry']","[' MaCe short for Mari Cerita Let s Tell a Story comes in the form of a monthly discussion that highlights various topics, from local Papuan languages to culinary adventures', ' In an effort to encourage conversation, and to foster recognition of Papua, nonprofit organization EcoNusa launched an initiative called MaCe Papua, highlighting Papuan stories', ' In an effort to encourage conversation, and to foster recognition of Papua, nonprofit organization EcoNusa launched an initiative called MaCe Papua, highlighting Papuan stories', ' For its initial discussion on Wednesday, EcoNusa brought in homegrown Papuan talents, inviting singer Michael Jakarimilena, author Raden Lukman and activist Lisa Duwiry']",[],[],"While most people are familiar with Indonesia s picturesque destinations think Bali and Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara Papua rarely comes up in conversation.

Exit polls and quick count results suggest a lead of 8 10 percentage points over his rival Prabowo Subianto, although the latter disputes the results. It s likely Prabowo will challenge the outcome in court, as happened after the last presidential election in 2014, but the appeal is likely to fail, and the challenger is likely to accept the verdict, as he did previously. This win is good news for Indonesia which, while frequently overlooked, is the world s largest Muslim majority country and has the largest economy in the Muslim world, and so this is also good news for the US and the world generally. The months long election campaign was marked by religious tensions, and both candidates sought hard to stress their Muslim credentials. However, Prabowo, while having close Christian relatives and not markedly religious himself, was the one who seemed likely to make genuine concessions to and alliances with Islamist radicals. One of these was Rizieq Shihab, the leader of the Islamic Defenders Front FPI , a thuggish group which has used intimidation and violence against Shia, Ahmadiyya, Christians, and night clubs, and anything else its leaders declared un Islamic. Rizieq was one of the major organizers of the massive demonstrations against former Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama BTP , an ethnic Chinese Christian and friend of Jokowi, who was subsequently jailed on trumped up blasphemy charges. Rezieq himself was investigated for pornography, blasphemy, and other offenses, and fled to Saudi Arabia, where he remains. In June 2018, Prabowo visited Rezieq in Mecca to win his endorsement, and promised to allow the FPI leader to return to Indonesia without charges should he win. Rizieq returned the favor, telling his supporters that they must vote for Prabowo if they wanted homosexuality banned. In February 2019, the chairman of the Habib Rizieq Shihab Center, Abdul Ramadan, declared that Rizieq Shihab said that if Prabowo won, he would go home. The week before the election, Prabowo organized a mass rally, which featured only Muslims and had the air of a religious revival. Rizieq addressed the crowd via a video from Saudi Arabia. On election day, Ben Rogers asked an FPI cadre about FPI s vision for Indonesia. He replied, Indonesia is a Muslim majority country. We want Islamic teachings to be implemented in full in every area of life Those who do not implement them, we give them a warning, and then we send in our Islamic Defenders Army. Rogers asked why FPI was supporting Prabowo. The reply was, Because he has promised us he will implement our vision. Jokowi, in office since 2014, has been critical of more restrictive forms of Islam, stressed religious toleration, and emphasized that the influential and increasingly radical semi official Indonesian Ulama Council MUI is simply an advisory body and does not make government policy. During the election, there were repeated attempts to portray him as anti Muslim. On February 25, 2019, three people were arrested for an online video that claimed that, if reelected, the president would ban the Muslim call to prayer, force women to remove their hijab in public, and legalize gay marriage. Consequently, Jokowi has sought to burnish his Islamic credentials. Three days before the election, he even set off on a pilgrimage to Mecca. In a notable move, Jokowi also selected Ma aruf Amin as his vice presidential running mate in order to head off criticism from more conservative Muslim groups. This was remarkable given that in 2017 Ma aruf was chairman of the MUI and in that capacity had accused BTP of blasphemy and called for him to be arrested. He was also a key witness at the trial and testified that BTP was a blasphemer. This led many to worry that Jokowi was seeking to appease radical forces. However, Ma aruf is 75 and has a background in politics rather than Islamism. After being selected, he shifted some of his stances and said that he regrets his previous testimony against BTP and that the former governor had been imprisoned. He also advised the MUI to steer clear of politics. In turn, after serving his sentence, BTP said that, if wanted, he was willing to campaign for his old friend Jokowi and was even willing to share a campaign stage with Ma aruf. Hence, Jokowi s outreach to more conservative Muslim groups can be understood as shorter term election tactics, while Prabowo s outreach to more radical elements signaled possible future alliances. Consequently, while a Jokowi administration may not be able to put a damper on radicalization, it is much more likely to do so than one led by Prabowo. Indonesian law limits presidents to two terms, so Jokowi cannot run again and has more freedom to implement an agenda closer to his own convictions. In the short term, two tests will indicate the role of religion in Indonesia. First, will the government circumscribe the authority of the MUI, and second, will it rein in local governments that, in violation of the constitution, have been enforcing contested Islamic precepts These will be bellwethers for whether Indonesia strengthens its tolerant traditions or slides into radicalism. Also, Prabowo is the son in law of the last dictator, Soeharto, and a former special forces general suspected of human rights abuses, while Jokowi is the first Indonesian president to come from outside the military and political establishment. So, his reelection helps cement democracy in Indonesia, a vitally important reason the US should warmly welcome it.

JG Photo Nur Yasmin Jakarta. While the presidential candidates made the final pitches in their political campaigns, activists from various background gathered at the offices of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, or YLBHI, in Jakarta on Saturday to declare their resolution to abstain from voting in this year's election. The movement, known as Golongan Putih, or Golput, is deeply rooted in resistance against the suppression of human rights during the military dictatorship of former President Suharto. The activists insist that little progress has been made so far by President Joko Jokowi Widodo, who surrounded himself with former generals with tainted human right records from Suharto's New Order regime. His rival, Prabowo Subianto, meanwhile, comes with heavy baggage of past human rights abuses of his own. The two contestants fighting for power in our country are still ignoring the basic rights of the people, Nining Elitos, chairwoman of the Congress Alliance of Indonesian Labor Unions Kasbi , said in her statement of why she refuses to vote. In Gresik in East Java , a union member is imprisoned for fighting to eliminate outsourcing. At Karawang in West Java , a worker fights for his rights but is prosecuted for illegal activity, she said, adding that workers are treated as mere objects by those seeking power. Activists from various other fields also voiced their discontent. The urban poor are flooded by promises and political contracts that have been signed by our current president, said Elisa Sanwijaya, a social development activist. There is no good intention from either of them presidential candidates to change the policies... For example, we repeatedly witness land expropriation, in the form of forced evictions by the government and the private sector in cities or villages.

While the presidential candidates made the final pitches in their political campaigns, activists from various background gathered at the offices of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, or YLBHI, in Jakarta on Saturday to declare their resolution to abstain from voting in this year's election.
The activists insist that little progress has been made so far by President Joko Jokowi Widodo, who surrounded himself with former generals with tainted human right records from Suharto's New Order regime.
The two contestants fighting for power in our country are still ignoring the basic rights of the people, Nining Elitos, chairwoman of the Congress Alliance of Indonesian Labor Unions Kasbi , said in her statement of why she refuses to vote.
At Karawang in West Java , a worker fights for his rights but is prosecuted for illegal activity, she said, adding that workers are treated as mere objects by those seeking power.

One person reported by phone from Vanimo that Indonesian soldiers entered Wutung village in motorbikes and trucks, and asked villagers if they had seen the people they were looking for. They were speaking in Bahasa Indonesian, and we replied that we did not know, the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. He said after the soldiers left, the villagers, numbering about 400, moved out of their settlement because they feared the soldiers might return. The villagers are scared because the Indonesian troops might mistake some of them for those they are looking for. With no PNG security forces on the ground there, they are very afraid, he said in Tok Pisin. The border people there have cultural links with people in Indonesian ruled West Papua, many through intermarriage. Many of the refugees who have crossed into PNG following the crackdown by the Indonesian military forces have been taken in by the villagers in Wutung and other nearby villagers. An official from the office of Sandaun Governor Robert Sakias said the governor will fly to Vanimo to attend to the escalating problem at the border. The official, Gabriel Dekwalen, said the governor, too, has received reports of West Papuans crossing the border into PNG, and of the incursions by Indonesian troops in pursuit of separatist elements. He said one reason only very sketchy information on the incident is coming out of the province is because of the shutdown of Radio West Sepik. He said the governor is seeking funds to pay the outstanding electricity bill of K 32,000, to get the station up and running again. The national government earlier promised to move PNG Defense Force PNGDF troops to the border, but that does not seem to have taken place. The PNGDF maintains troops at garrison strength at Vanimo. In Limbo More than 300 West Papuan border crossers, mainly women and children, are in limbo at the border, the Papua New Guinea Post Courier reported. Bishop Bonaventu said many of the border crossers are falling ill. They are West Papuans who fled clashes between Indonesian soldiers and West Papua freedom fighters and are either in neutral territory between the Papua New Guinea and Indonesian borders or just inside Papua New Guinea territory. Bishop Bonaventu said the PNG government considered the people border crossers and not refugees at the moment. The government could is suspicious that the crossers could be used by the OPM Free Papua Movement as a shield to fight Indonesian forces. I understand the position of the government. The PNG government has been very good in looking after border crossers and refugees, he said. It has a good record of that. He said the Catholic Church had been looking after the crossers since last Tuesday but had since been told not to do anything for them by the government. He said various groups had since offered to help the border crossers through the Catholic Church, which was willing and ready to help. Provincial Affairs Secretary Leo Meninga was unavailable yesterday to clarify the government s position. His director of border and special projects Chris Kati did not return calls. Meantime, the West Papua community has been refused permission to march to the Indonesian Embassy in Port Moresby because of fears other people will take advantage of the situation and cause problems in the city, police said. Police Commissioner John Wakon said he refused to grant the permission for security reasons. National Capital District Central police commander Tom Kulunga said police have been stationed around the embassy since Friday.

POLICE CHIEF BANS SEPARATIST GROUP IN WEST PAPUA JAYAPURA, Irian Jaya, Indonesia Dec. 13, 2000 Radio Australia The police chief of West Papua has banned the National Liberation Force, an armed civilian separatist group operating in the remote jungles of the Indonesian province. The ban was contained in a circular issued by police chief Brigadier General Sylvanus Wenas. The circular said the organization clearly was formed to provide resistance against the lawful government with the aim of seceding from the sovereign territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. It said that the ban was imposed after taking into consideration the security developments in West Papua since December 1. Jakarta has already long outlawed the Free Papua Organization, which has been waging a guerrilla war against Indonesia for more than 30 years. In the capital of Jayapura alone, 155 independence supporters and students have been arrested in the past fortnight, of whom 12 are still being held.

President Joko Widodo has declared victory in the presidential election of Indonesia, the world s third largest democracy. But his challenger Prabowo Subianto has also claimed his win while also complaining of widespread cheating . The standoff comes as security officials and analysts warned of potential violence in the world s most populous Muslim nation over the election dispute. On Thursday, unofficial results from private pollsters based on vote samples from Wednesday s election pointed to a comfortable win for Widodo, with about 55 percent of the popular vote, giving him a lead of almost 10 percentage points over his rival, former general Subianto. The counts from reputable pollsters have proved to be accurate in previous elections, though the official result will not be announced until May 22. Widodo told reporters he had received congratulatory calls from 22 state leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he invited his rival to meet. We all know that the QC quick count calculation is a scientific calculation method. From the country s experiences of past elections the accuracy is 99.9 percent, almost the same as real count results, Widodo said. He also urged supporters to wait for official results to confirm the win. Widespread cheating At a separate news conference just minutes after Widodo declared victory, Prabowo appeared defiant and said his team had evidence of cheating and claimed to have won 62 percent of the popular vote based on internal polling. We have declared victory because we got evidence of widespread cheating at the village, sub district and district levels across Indonesia, he said, standing next to his running mate, Sandiaga Uno, who looked more subdued. In 2014, Prabowo also claimed victory on election day before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo s win. A spokesman for Prabowo said he would take his complaint to the Constitutional Court if the Election Commission confirmed Widodo s victory. The commission said earlier on its website Widodo had secured about 50 percent of the vote, based on results from 808 of more than 800,000 polling stations, with Prabowo securing about 45 percent vote. The English daily Jakarta Post carried a front page headline declaring Five More Years next to a picture of the president. Alexander Raymond Arifianto, a political analyst at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said Widodo s margin of victory meant the opposition did not appear to have a strong case to claim the election was stolen. But he noted supporters of the challenger, including the hardline Alumni 212 movement, could hit the streets to dispute the election. So Prabowo has no case but the hardliners and Alumni 212 can create lots of headaches for Jokowi if they go ahead with their protest plan tomorrow and in future weeks, he said, referring to the president by his nickname. Peaceful march Novel Bamukmin, a spokesman for Alumni 212, said the movement planned a peaceful march after Friday prayers at Jakarta s Istiqlal Mosque. We just want to bow down to express our gratitude in order that this victory is recognised, he said, referring to Prabowo s claim he won the election. Religious groups have in the past been able to mobilise tens of thousands of supporters. Since late 2016, they organised a series of big protests against Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the first ethnic Chinese Christian to hold the job, who was subsequently jailed for insulting the Quran. Police vowed firm action against any rallies that could disturb security. I appeal to anyone not to mobilise, whether to mobilise people to celebrate victory or mobilise due to dissatisfaction, said national police chief Tito Karnavian. Avoid anarchy At the same news conference, Chief Security Minister Wiranto called for people to avoid any act of anarchy that breaches the law . Wiranto, who uses a single name, added security forces will act decisively against any threats to order and security. Indonesia is an outpost of democracy in a southeast Asian neighbourhood of authoritarian governments and is forecast to be among the world s biggest economies by 2030. A second term for Widodo, the first Indonesian president from outside the Jakarta elite, could further cement the country s two decades of democratisation. The election was a huge logistical exercise with 193 million people eligible to vote, more than 800,000 polling stations, and 17 million people involved in ensuring the polls ran smoothly. Helicopters, boats and horses were used to get ballots to remote and inaccessible corners of the sprawling archipelago.

According to the 2017 General Election Law, a party must have at least 4 percent of the vote to be represented in the national legislature. Based on the quick count results, the PSI will be the fourth largest party in Jakarta. Of course, we are still waiting for the official recapitulation by the General Elections Commission KPU , Michael Victor Sianipar, a PSI representative for Jakarta, said in a press release the Jakarta Globe received. The CSIS Cyrus Network estimates that the PSI attracted 7.98 percent of the vote in Jakarta. The ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle PDI P gained most of the vote, at 23.05 percent, followed by the Prosperous Justice Party PKS at 16.4 percent and the opposition Great Indonesia Movement Party Gerindra at 14.87 percent. Another pollster, Indobarometer, has put the PSI's share of the vote at 8.11 percent, after the PDI P 25.07 percent , PKS 17.49 percent and Gerindra 15.26 percent . This is an extraordinary achievement. We thank the people of Jakarta, who have given us their trust and the opportunity, putting us to the test and allowing us to show our character. We believe your trust will not be in vain. We will prove it with our sincere intentions, hard work and integrity in the Jakarta Regional Legislature over the next five years, Michael said. He added that the PSI has worked hard to select the best legislative candidates in a process involving public participation, and that it had even embarked on a fundraising drive to help the best people enter politics and campaign in the election. He said the PSI would present constructive opposition to the current governor, Anies Baswedan. There is still a lot of homework to do in Jakarta. Human development and infrastructure must be more just and progressive. As an opposition party, the PSI will ensure Governor Anies's programs are even better. We will not hesitate to criticize, but we also want to offer solutions and we are willing to sit down together. That is the hope of the citizens of Jakarta, that there will be no more political division. Let's put forward the development of Jakarta together, Michael said. Not the End PSI chairwoman Grace Natalie meanwhile released a statement on Wednesday conceding defeat, but said the party remains optimistic. Although we did not enter the national legislature based on the quick count results, it should be noted that about 2 percent, or around 3 million people, have voted for the PSI. This is the people's voice that must be taken into account and we will continue fighting, Grace said at the party headquarters in Jakarta. Polls conducted last year showed the five year old party's support at less than 1 percent, far from the required 4 percent. No votes are wasted. Every vote for the PSI will be recorded and counted as a statement of courage, the voice of the people, who want the national legislature and political parties to improve, Grace said. She encouraged the 3 million people who voted for the party to register as members. Most of the self proclaimed millennial party's members are between the ages of 20 and 30. To the 3 million PSI voters, I urge you to immediately register as members at www.psi.id, or at the nearest PSI office. We will immediately consolidate ourselves, Grace said.

Election monitors are worried that the flow of misinformation stoking ethnic and religious divides could undermine electoral bodies and even raise social tensions.

As a candidate, you cannot throw claims into the air ... we will fact check them. Backed financially by Google News Lab, which also helps fund Mafindo, Cekfakta's volunteers took over the U.S tech giant's swanky Jakarta office for the debate on March 30. Dhyatmika wanted to avoid a repeat of the 2014 election, also between Widodo and retired general Prabowo, when reporters were unprepared for the flood of false news that swept across social media.

Mafindo's head of fact checking, Aribowo Sasmito, compares it to the drug trade. There are the factories, the dealers, and the victims. Most of the people who end up arrested are victims ... They read hoaxes and believed them to be true. Since December, Mafindo has documented a surge in political fake news using ethnicity and religion to target both candidates. The organisation finds most worrisome the dozens of stories that paint electoral bodies as corrupt. This will be only Indonesia's fourth democratic presidential election. Sasmito considers it a good result if fact checked posts can reach even a small fraction of the audience the originals did. Mafindo's work has made it some enemies. The group has received enough threats that it keeps its office address secret Cefakta's website was hacked after a previous debate. A Reuters investigation in March found that both the Prabowo and Widodo campaigns were funding sophisticated social media operations to spread propaganda and disinformation through fake accounts on behalf of the candidates. L3N20Z2EH Both campaigns said they did not use such teams. FAKE NEWS CREATORS One journalist said he was hired by Prabowo campaign advisers to write positive stories about Prabawo and negative ones on Widodo, to be posted on Facebook and WhatsApp. He said he was not motivated by money but believes the mainstream media is biased in favour of Widodo. Fearing government retaliation, the man declined to be named, but he showed Reuters communications that suggested he was he in contact with Prabowo advisers. He said he wrote only true negative stories, and cited as an example a post that 2,000 Chinese workers on Indonesia's Sulawesi island were secretly part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We have evidence from government contacts and we can see they are soldiers from the way they look, he said, declining to share such evidence. Prabowo campaign spokesman Andre Rosiadi denied any advisers had hired journalists to write positive or negative content and especially not fake news. Asked about the Sulawesi allegation, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia replied to Reuters in a text fake news. But such claims also make it onto the campaign trail. A Prabowo campaign volunteer in West Java told Reuters last week that millions of Chinese workers had been secretly relocated to Sulawesi. It's not hoax, it's fact, said volunteer Cecep Abdul Halim. Reuters found that the creator of the Sulawesi claim had also written stories in 2016 falsely depicting former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjaha Purnama as a Communist stooge of China. Purnama, a Christian ethnic Chinese Indonesian ally of Widodo, recently completed a two year prison sentence for blasphemy against Islam based on a video doctored to make him seem he was insulting the Koran. The man convicted of making the video, a former journalist, worked for Prabowo's media team until he was sent to prison last month. A campaign spokesman confirmed he had worked for the media team, but did not comment further. Social media data gathered by Mafindo as well as Indonesian big data consultancy Drone Emprit shows that allegations using China as a bogeyman are widespread in Indonesia, where suspicions about the wealth of the ethnic Chinese community and the influence of Beijing run deep. A disproven video that went viral in January claimed to show seven shipping containers from China at Jakarta's port filled with millions of ballots punctured in favour of Widodo. Common misinformation themes against Widodo portray him alternatively as a member of Indonesia's banned Communist party, a Chinese plant, or anti Islam. Prabowo, meanwhile, has been depicted as both impious and planning to create a caliphate, while his running mate has been portrayed inaccurately as gay. All are inflammatory accusations in the world's largest Muslim majority country, which rights groups say recently has seen increased prejudice against religious and LGBT minorities. And the stories work. Although Widodo enjoys a double digit lead over Prabowo, three surveys found that a minority of the population believes that he is either a communist or a Christian. According to a December poll, as many as 42 percent of Prabowo supporters believed this about Widodo, while 65 percent of Widodo supporters believed Prabowo kidnapped democracy activists while in the military, a claim he strenuously denies. Experts say such polarisation is dangerous for Indonesia and could stoke anger against minorities. This kind of fake news gains traction because they're the seeds of intolerance in our society, said Cefakta's Dhyatmika. And it's not being addressed.

The attack took place when a convoy of 25 soldiers had arrived Thursday at Mugi district, in Nduga, the same municipality where in December a rebel group had executed 19 workers of a state construction firm, who were working on the Trans Papua road megaproject. That morning we were suddenly attacked by 50 to 70 separatists that caused the death of three of our soldiers, army spokesperson in Papua, Muhamad Aidi, told EFE. According to Muhamad, between seven and 10 separatists were killed in the clash before they fled into the jungle, and the army could only retrieve one body. The spokesperson of West Papua National Liberation Army TPNPB the rebel organization responsible for the attack, Sebby Sambom, claimed that five soldiers were killed but did not mention any casualty in their ranks, according to a statement sent to EFE. The army troops were deployed in Mugi to protect the construction of a road linking the localities of Wamena to Mumugu, in a difficult mountainous terrain. Hundreds of troops have been sent to safeguard the nearly 4,600 kilometers 2,858 miles of road networks planned for Papua, after a faction of the separatist group operating in Nduga began to step up attacks in December. The armed conflict has also left hundreds of people internally displaced in the region, and led to the closure of schools and other services. TPNPB has included infrastructure projects in Papua among its targets, considering them to cater to the interests of the Indonesian state and posing a threat to the guerrilla outfit, while also facilitating the plunder of this under developed province. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made the development of Papua and other remote areas of the archipelago one of his priorities.

In this long journey, in 2017, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources ESDM Ignasius Jonan had invited Chevron to extend its contract because it would expire in 2021. Pertamina also submitted a proposal to manage the Rokan Block starting 2021. This was done to align with the world's top oil companies. Finally on July 31, 2018, the fight was settled.

Thousands of supporters dressed in white marched from the National Monument Monas in Central Jakarta to the sports complex to join celebrities, musicians and prominent politicians participating in the massive event themed White in Unity.

Nearly four times more members of the security force were deployed than during last week's rally by presidential rival Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno. Here are some details about Saturday's event Inclusivity Hasto Kristiyanto, secretary general of the Jokowi Ma'ruf campaign team, said on Thursday that anyone would be welcome to join the rally, unlike the event held by Prabowo Sandiaga. He said Jokowi's rally was exactly the kind of event former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had in mind when he criticized Prabowo for his mass gathering, which excluded certain groups. Yudhoyono is the co founder and chairman of the Democratic Party, which supports Prabowo's presidential bid. We wanted the kind of campaign SBY had in mind an inclusive campaign, not restricted to certain groups showing Indonesia's true colors, Hasto said, referring to the former president by his initials. Everyone could come without registering, said the politician, who also serves as secretary general of the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle PDI P , the main party endorsing Jokowi. He added that people of all social, ethnic and religious backgrounds were welcome to attend. Supporters of Jokowi and Ma'ruf seen during Saturday's rally at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.

Incumbent President Joko Jokowi Widodo and his running mate Ma'ruf Amin made a spectacular show of force at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Central Jakarta on Saturday, during their last public rally ahead of the upcoming presidential and legislative elections.
Thousands of supporters dressed in white marched from the National Monument Monas in Central Jakarta to the sports complex to join celebrities, musicians and prominent politicians participating in the massive event themed White in Unity.
Nearly four times more members of the security force were deployed than during last week's rally by presidential rival Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno. Here are some details about Saturday's event Inclusivity Hasto Kristiyanto, secretary general of the Jokowi Ma'ruf campaign team, said on Thursday that anyone would be welcome to join the rally, unlike the event held by Prabowo Sandiaga.
He said Jokowi's rally was exactly the kind of event former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had in mind when he criticized Prabowo for his mass gathering, which excluded certain groups.
We wanted the kind of campaign SBY had in mind an inclusive campaign, not restricted to certain groups showing Indonesia's true colors, Hasto said, referring to the former president by his initials.

Leaders from the coalition of nine political parties supporting the incumbent were also present, while the widely popular governor of West Java, Ridwan Kamil, also showed his face.
How Many Participants Hasto estimated that about 600,000 people attended Saturday's rally, although the stadium can only seat about 160,000.

Arief Budiman, chairman of the General Elections Commission KPU , said at a press conference at the agency's offices in Menteng, Central Jakarta, on Monday that at least 91 have died and 374 have fallen ill while carrying out their duties. He said the KPU held a meeting to discuss the amount of compensation that would be offered to the families of those who have died.

The KPU suggests maximum compensation of Rp 30 million for workers who have become disabled due to accidents while on duty. The amount will vary in accordance with the degree of disability. For injuries, we suggest a maximum of Rp 16 million, he said. The KPU plans to meet with the Ministry of Finance to discuss details of the compensation, including procedures for providing compensation and preparing the budget. The government had allocated Rp 25 trillion for this year's elections, but rejected the KPU's proposal to include insurance coverage for election workers. The victims comprise police officers, polling station guards and election officials in 19 provinces. Most of them collapsed from exhaustion after the physically draining vote counting process. Others fell ill or died in accidents. Many people took to social media to voice their shock and grief at the news. Sedih banget bacain berita kayak gini dari kemarin.

The claims were part of presentations to the council by the West Papua National Committee, or KNPB, on Wednesday in Geneva. KNPB spokesperson Victor Yeimo told the council's 40th session that Indonesian military forces in Nduga have violated Papuans' human rights. Joint military and police operation start last December in Nduga region, feeding excessive use of force. More than 2,000 people have become IDPs, houses were burned down and more than 25 civilians were dead.

Indonesian state media reported in February that more than 400 students and 80 teachers had been displaced by violence in the Central Highlands regency. However, the military has said its decision to deploy 600 additional combat soldiers to the region last week was to safeguard state construction work and protect civilians from Papuan rebels.

Mr Djani said the West Papua Liberation Army were responsible for attacks in Nduga, including the killing of four Indonesian soldiers last week.

Supporters of President Joko Jokowi Widodo filled a stadium in central Jakarta, while the vice presidential running mate of challenger Prabowo Subianto held a rally in a satellite city. Speaking to a crowd of more than 100,000, Widodo emphasized the importance of his big ticket infrastructure policy and education for the country's future development. He said pluralism is non negotiable in Muslim majority Indonesia, addressing supporters' fears about the aims of a conservative Islamic movement that backs Subianto. People in a developing nation must be optimistic because we still have big jobs to do and face big challenges, Widodo said. Widodo and Subianto appeared in the final of five televised debates between the presidential and vice presidential candidates on Saturday evening. About 193 million Indonesians are eligible to vote Wednesday in presidential and legislative elections. Widodo, who narrowly defeated Subianto in the 2014 election, is Indonesia's first president from outside the Jakarta elite. Subianto is an establishment figure from a wealthy family who was a special forces general during the Suharto dictatorship that ended amid social and economic chaos in 1998. Subianto's running mate, Sandiaga Uno, told a crowd of thousands in Tangerang that a government led by them would focus on ensuring Indonesians had good jobs and a lower cost of living. We will be able to unite the country and make this country very strong, said Uno, a businessman who has spent more than 100 million on the campaign. Subianto supporter Akhirudin Konsi said he wants a president who will fight for our rights and stand behind people, who will lower prices, especially education, fuel and basic needs. Polls show Widodo has maintained a big lead over Subianto for months, but some analysts say the race is tighter than it appears. Businessman Sahala Panjaitan said he and four family members came to Jakarta for Widodo's rally from Pontianak in West Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo.

Unofficial results from private pollsters based on vote samples from Wednesday s election pointed to a comfortable win for Widodo, with about 55 percent of the popular vote, giving him a lead of almost 10 percentage points over his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto. The counts from reputable pollsters have proved to be accurate in previous elections, though the official result will not be announced until May 22. Widodo told reporters he had received congratulatory calls from 22 state leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he had invited his rival to meet. Widodo also urged supporters to wait for official results to confirm the win. At a separate news conference just minutes after Widodo declared victory, Prabowo appeared defiant and said his team had evidence of cheating and claimed to have won 62 percent of the popular vote based on internal polling. We have declared victory because we got evidence of widespread cheating at the village, sub district and district levels across Indonesia, he said, standing next to his running mate, Sandiaga Uno, who looked more subdued. In 2014, Prabowo had also claimed victory on election day, before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo s win. A spokesman for Praboow said he would take his complaint to the Constitutional Court if the Election Commission confirmed Widodo s victory. The commission said earlier on its website Widodo had secured about 50 percent of the vote, based on results from 808 of more than 800,000 polling stations, with Prabowo on about 45 percent. Indonesia's presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto waves to the media after delivering an election victory declaration in Jakarta, Indonesia, April 18, 2019. REUTERS Willy Kurniawan The English language Jakarta Post newspaper carried a front page headline declaring Five More Years next to a picture of the president. Financial markets surged early on Thursday on Widodo s apparent victory, though gains were pared in the afternoon. The rupiah currency ended the day up 0.3 percent from the previous close, and the Jakarta stock index at one point up 2.4 percent closed 0.4 percent higher. NO CASE Alexander Raymond Arifianto, a political analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies RSIS in Singapore, said Widodo s margin of victory meant the opposition did not appear to have a strong case to claim the election was stolen. But he noted risks that Islamist supporters of the challenger, including the hardline Alumni 212 movement, could hit the streets to dispute the election. So Prabowo has no case, but the hardliners and Alumni 212 can create lots of headaches for Jokowi if they go ahead with their protest plan tomorrow and in future weeks, he said, referring to president by his nickname. Novel Bamukmin, a spokesman for Alumni 212, said the movement planned a peaceful march after Friday prayers at Jakarta s Istiqlal mosque. We just want to bow down to express our gratitude in order that this victory is recognised, he said, referring to Prabowo s claim he won the election. Islamist groups have in the past been able to mobilise tens of thousands of supporters. From late 2016, they organised a series of big protests against the Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the first ethnic Chinese Christian to hold the job, who was subsequently jailed for insulting the Koran.

Unofficial results from private pollsters based on vote samples from Wednesday s election pointed to a comfortable win for Widodo, with about 55 percent of the popular vote, giving him a lead of almost 10 percentage points over his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto.
At a separate news conference just minutes after Widodo declared victory, Prabowo appeared defiant and said his team had evidence of cheating and claimed to have won 62 percent of the popular vote based on internal polling.
In 2014, Prabowo had also claimed victory on election day, before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo s win.
A spokesman for Praboow said he would take his complaint to the Constitutional Court if the Election Commission confirmed Widodo s victory.
The commission said earlier on its website Widodo had secured about 50 percent of the vote, based on results from 808 of more than 800,000 polling stations, with Prabowo on about 45 percent.
So Prabowo has no case, but the hardliners and Alumni 212 can create lots of headaches for Jokowi if they go ahead with their protest plan tomorrow and in future weeks, he said, referring to president by his nickname.
Novel Bamukmin, a spokesman for Alumni 212, said the movement planned a peaceful march after Friday prayers at Jakarta s Istiqlal mosque.
We just want to bow down to express our gratitude in order that this victory is recognised, he said, referring to Prabowo s claim he won the election.

Indonesia has been focusing on the prevention and eradication of terrorism funding, and conflict resolution in the Middle East since assuming its seat as a non permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in January, a government official said last week. We have been in the Security Council since Jan. 1, 2019 in the first three months we discussed terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, New Zealand, Afghanistan, the Philippines and Iran, Febrian A. Ruddyard, director general of multilateral cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in Jakarta on March 28. He said Indonesia also ensures that the council attends to all acts of terrorism equally. One of Indonesia's achievements as non permanent member so far is the drafting of a resolution on extending the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or Unama. This is our first ever resolution we ever drafted this is Indonesia's achievement, Febri said. Middle Eastern conflict, including Palestine, were also addressed in the forum. He said Indonesia would continue to support Palestine by promoting the two state solution to end the conflict. The two state solution is the most reasonable solution and we also talked about humanitarian crisis management in Gaza, Febri said. He added that Indonesia has succeeded to show within the Security Council that the United States is the only country hampering peace between Israel and Palestine. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi visited a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan during March last year to deliver the Indonesian government's commitment of 1 million in humanitarian aid. Peacekeeping Indonesia will assume the rotating presidency of the Security Council in May, which according to Febri, will see UN peacekeeping efforts topping the agenda. We would like to strengthen UN peacekeeping and the role of women in peacekeeping activities, he explained. To enforce this commitment, Indonesia will convene assemblies on peacekeeping operations and protection of civilians in armed conflicts. During its council presidency, Indonesia will also head the sanctions committee on Islamic State, Al Qaida, the Taliban and nuclear weapons, the foreign ministry official said. Support for New Resolution The ministry meanwhile also said in a press release on Tuesday that Indonesia supported a UN General Assembly resolution on combating acts of terrorism and religiously motivated violence, following the recent attack by a gunman on two mosques in New Zealand. No country is free from racism, intolerance and hatred there is a demand for joint actions to encourage global dialogue, promoting tolerance and peace, Retno told the General Assembly, as quoted in the statement. During the session, Indonesia stated its readiness to share its experiences as a country that has succeeded in maintaining peace and harmony, despite significant cultural, religious and racial diversity.

Antara Photo Indrianto Eko Suwarso Jakarta. Presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto said in a speech during yet another victory declaration on Friday that people would take to the streets if his camp found that the quick count results of the April 17 presidential election had been manipulated. During a gathering in South Jakarta, the former Army general claimed for the fourth time in two days that he had won the 2019 presidential election, based on data compiled by his campaign team. The gathering was initially planned for the Istiqlal Mosque, the country's largest, in Central Jakarta, but later moved out of respect for Christians celebrating Good Friday, which is a public holiday in Indonesia. The mosque is across the road from the Jakarta Cathedral. If there are clear efforts to infringe on the people's rights, we won't accept it. We, all of us, will take action in accordance with the Constitution, Prabowo said during the Gratitude for Victory in the 2019 Presidential Election event at his family residence in Jalan Kertanegara. In what appears to have been a subtle call on supporters to prepare for mass action, he said Indonesia's 1945 Constitution guarantees the right of all citizens to gather in the streets and express their opinions. However, he called on supporters not to be provoked by narratives from those he claimed are planning to disrupt the national unity. There is nothing wrong with us upholding justice. We want truth and justice he said. Yudhoyono Raises Concern Democratic Party chairman Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is an influential ally of Prabowo, warned members of his party on Friday not to commit any unconstitutional acts. He also ordered those serving on Prabowo's campaign team to return to the party's headquarters to consolidate. The former president is still in Singapore, where his wife is currently receiving medical treatment. Regarding the political situation after the election, which shows increasing tension and could lead to a dangerous political and security situation, I instruct all officials ... to continue monitoring closely what is happening in the motherland, Yudhoyono reportedly said. 'Habib Organization' Calls for Unity Habib Zen bin Smith, chairman of Rabithah Alawiyah, an organization for habib, or Islamic scholars from the Sayyid community, who are descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, released a statement on Friday calling for national unity in Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority country. Whatever the results, we must maintain ukhuwah a brotherly spirit . Elections are important, but what is more important, is to maintain our unity as a nation, he said. Meanwhile, in response to Prabowo's apparent call for mass action, Indonesian Military TNI chief Air Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto warned that the military would not tolerate any moves that may disturb the peace.

Presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto said in a speech during yet another victory declaration on Friday that people would take to the streets if his camp found that the quick count results of the April 17 presidential election had been manipulated.
During a gathering in South Jakarta, the former Army general claimed for the fourth time in two days that he had won the 2019 presidential election, based on data compiled by his campaign team.
The gathering was initially planned for the Istiqlal Mosque, the country's largest, in Central Jakarta, but later moved out of respect for Christians celebrating Good Friday, which is a public holiday in Indonesia.
We, all of us, will take action in accordance with the Constitution, Prabowo said during the Gratitude for Victory in the 2019 Presidential Election event at his family residence in Jalan Kertanegara.
In what appears to have been a subtle call on supporters to prepare for mass action, he said Indonesia's 1945 Constitution guarantees the right of all citizens to gather in the streets and express their opinions.
However, he called on supporters not to be provoked by narratives from those he claimed are planning to disrupt the national unity.
Elections are important, but what is more important, is to maintain our unity as a nation, he said.

Yansen Adrys David, heading Polling Station TPS No. 5 in Bengkalis City, Riau Province, passed away on April 20 of a heart attack, after working for two days at a stretch after serving several hundreds of voters on polling day. In Bantan Tua Village, Bantan Sub district, also Bengkalis District, Suratinizar, head of the TPS No. 2, lost his life in a traffic accident on April 18, 2019. There were indications that he may have been exhausted. He returned home from the polling station at 2 a.m. local time On April 18 . He later headed to his office for work, and in the afternoon, en route home, he lost his life in a traffic accident. Bengkalis General Election Office KPU Head Fadihilah Al Mausuly confirmed the deaths of two heads of the Bengkalis polling station working committees KPPS from exhaustion after clocking lengthy hours on polling day. In Riau, five people were reported to have died in election related incidents, while 13 officers fell ill from exhaustion. No less than three officers reportedly blacked out during counting of ballots in Pekanbaru, Kampar, and Pelalawan District, Riau, respectively. Rustam Efendi, secretary of the KPU office in Manokwari, West Papua confirmed that the electoral process was very exhausting because it took a long time and needed extra accuracy. It took more than 10 hours to run a polling station, from the voting process and the ballot counting to the recapitulation of all the ballots, he noted. The polling stations opened their doors at 7 a.m. local time and many finished the counting process at 4 a.m., or 6 a.m. and some even at 10 a.m. the following day. The election officers had a tough task because they had to serve voters and finish the counting of the ballots. They only had breaks for meals, while Muslims had prayer breaks, he said. Basically, election officers had to work continuously for nearly 48 hours, as they had to arrange the logistics and facilities for the electoral process, one day prior to polling day. They did not sleep well for at least two days and two nights as they were thinking about their tasks, he said. On polling day, voters cast their ballot for the president and vice president, members of the House of Representatives DPR , senators of the Regional Representative Councils DPD , members of the Provincial Legislative Council DPRD 1 , and members of the District Municipality Legislative Council DPRD II . Numerous voters were taken aback by the complex nature of the elections along with low knowledge on whom to elect, apart from the president and vice president. They were given five ballots of different colors. In Pondok Gede, Bekasi City, West Java Province, for instance, a ballot for DPD has 50 pictures of senator candidates, while ballots of DPR, DPRD I, and DPRD II, bore pictures of 20 political parties in every ballot, and each party fielded nearly 11 legislator candidates. With the polling stations closing down in the afternoon on voting day, officers had to begin counting votes that generally lasted until the next day. Throughout Indonesia, the death toll was 54 TPS officers and 10 police officers, while 34 others were reported to have taken ill from overwork, according to Viryan Azis, KPU Commissioner in Jakarta, April 22. House Speaker Bambang Soesatyo has condoled the deaths of the election officers. I convey my deepest condolences to the victims and their families. Their sacrifice in upholding democracy in Indonesia will not be in vain, Soesatyo said in a statement. The election system is complex and polling stations located in regions with a difficult terrain can result in exhaustion and physical pressures that are unavoidable. Organizing an election can be time consuming and can even claim lives, he remarked. He appealed to the government to compensate the families of those who lost their lives. The senior Golkar politician also urged local administrations to provide free medical services to election officers, police and military personnel, who fell ill during election duty. In fact, from the onset, they should have been covered with life and medical insurances. Families of the officers who are either sick or dead should have been helped by the State, he added. While the duration of the campaign was seven months, the election process itself was complicated, and the field officers were not covered by any insurance schemes, he noted. The government should learn a lesson from this year's elections and make a note for the future, he said. The public would like to see a better organized election the next time, and this necessitates a change in the system, he stated. The changes must be carried out from top to bottom and safety of field officers must be made a priority, he added. Sharing the House Speaker s view, Vice President M. Jusuf Kalla has sought to conduct an evaluation of the implementation of the election since it was labeled a complicated process. Kalla suggested that the 2024 presidential and legislative election should be held separately. The just ended elections were not only exhausting, but also allegedly marred by problems such as delayed delivery of election logistics, natural disasters, or cases of poll violations. Hence, Bawaslu ordered reelection to be held in the provinces of Banten, East Java, South Sulawesi, West Sumatra, Jambi, and Papua, among others. The House Speaker appealed to the KPU, local KPUs KPUD , and the Election Supervisory Board Bawasu to ensure that revoting is conducted free of any violations and lapses. In addition, the Indonesian Rector Forum FRI has released a statement in which it has asked election executors to maintain neutrality and demonstrate the highest levels of commitment to work. Hence, we appeal to those tasked with executing the 2019 elections, specifically the KPU, Bawaslu, and the Honorary Council of Election Executors DKPP , to remain self reliant and neutral along with guaranteeing that the vote counting process is held in line with the existent regulations, FRI Chairperson Prof. Dr Dwi Aries Tina Palubuhu MA remarked April 22, 2019. The FRI also appealed to the public to always put the nation's interests over and above those of particular groups or persons. The rectors also sought professionalism from the police and military in their work along with maintaining a neutral stance while putting the nation's interest above all. They also called on presidential candidates and political parties to exercise patience as they await the outcome of the vote counting by the KPU. Meanwhile, the preliminary election result from the KPU's Ballot Count Information System Situng showed Incumbent Joko Widodo Jokowi and Ma'ruf Amin securing 11,608,261 votes, or 54.76 percent. The pair of challenger Prabowo Subianto and Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno won 9,589,418 votes, or 45.24 percent, according to Situng data monitored on the official KPU website, April 22 at 7 15 a.m. local time. The KPU Situng had made an entry of the ballots after referring to data received from C1 ballot count forms filled in by election officers at polling stations. The commission has, until now, entered C1 form data from 111,572 TPS, of the total 813,350 TPS across countries and Indonesian representative offices overseas.

Although pre election polls suggest Jokowi, 57, is likely to win a second term, he's copped criticism from analysts and former supporters who say he has failed to deliver on issues such as human rights and compromised his values of pluralism to score political points. Ulet Ifansasti Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo waves to the crowd following his inauguration on October 20, 2014 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Jokowi's choice of a hardline Muslim cleric running mate, for example, might turn off people who voted for him in 2014 for his commitment to religious freedom. Jokowi's credentials as a reformer don't look as good because he's made so many compromises with the mainstream, said Ben Bland, director of Southeast Asia project at think tank Lowy Institute. In 2019 , he's a very different kind of figure. Wave of hope In 2014, there was a sense that Indonesian democracy itself was at stake. For 32 years, Indonesia was ruled by President Suharto, an authoritarian dictator who used the military to keep the country in check. After he was driven from office in 1998 by rioting and political chaos, Indonesia brought in new reforms, including limiting presidential terms to five years and allowing freedom of the press. Ulet Ifansasti Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian incumbent Presidential candidate Joko Widodo, is greeted by his supporters at the Sriwedari stadium during an election campaign rally on April 9, 2019 in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia. Prabowo, who had been Suharto's son in law, indicated he would roll back democratic reform and reinstate the supremacy of the president. Jokowi, by contrast, was a breath of fresh air. Winning 53 of the vote he became the first Indonesian president without a connection to the military or the country's traditional elite. The euphoria was comparable with Obama's first term, says Ella Prihatini, an academic with the Center for Muslim States and Societies at the University of Western Australia. During his first term, the furniture entrepreneur turned politician has had some success. Jokowi extended access to education and health for the poor, rolled out social programs early on in his term and has created 10 million new jobs during the past four years. He's also made huge strides in infrastructure, building 950 kilometers of toll roads, 3,400 kilometers of highways, 40 kilometers of bridges, 10 new airports, 19 ports and 17 dams. Earlier this year, the country opened its first subway line in Jakarta. And importantly, his approval rating remains over 50 . But he has also failed to meet expectations in a number of areas. The country has maintained an average 5 GDP growth rate less than Jokowi's 7 target, and level with what has been achieved since 2000. Prabowo has seized on his rival's economic failings, slamming Jokowi for allowing food prices to rise and calling for better quality jobs. And Jokowi hasn't had much success cracking down on corruption, upholding human rights, or protecting minorities, says Vedi Hadiz, director and professor of Asian Studies at Melbourne University. Jokowi began his presidency by signing off on executions by firing squad of eight drug offenders, despite international outcry. Despite saying he would address past human rights injustices during his 2014 campaign, he's yet to do so. And according to Human Rights Watch, police have conducted arbitrary and unlawful raids on private LGBT gatherings, while people continue to be imprisoned for blasphemy. Police have previously denied targeting the LGBT community and, in the lead up to this year's election, Jokowi denied overseeing any rights violations. There's a lot of concerns that in some respects, democracy has gone backwards under Jokowi's watch either because of him or maybe despite him, said Bland. A man of compromises Jokowi has been dogged by criticism that he isn't Muslim enough to lead Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim population where almost 90 of the population follow Islam and just under 10 are Christian or Catholic, according to the country's statistics department. In an apparent bid to neutralize those concerns, Jokowi has selected 76 year old Muslim cleric Ma'ruf Amin as his vice presidential running mate. Ma'ruf chairs an Islamic council with a long history of intolerant views, including calling for the criminalization of homosexual sex. When Jokowi announced his running mate last year, he said I think we complete each other, nationalistic and religious. Despite the president consistently promoting pluralism in public, there has been a rising influence of Islamist elements in Indonesia during his terms. After Jokowi assumed the presidency a Christian also known as Ahok, or Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, took over the his post in the Jakarta governorship. In 2017, Ahok was sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy after telling voters they should not be duped by religious leaders using a passage from the Quran to say that non Muslims couldn't lead Muslims. His comments angered hardline Muslim groups, who turned out in force to rally against him. Jokowi called for calm, urging Indonesians to trust in the legal system, but some felt the court had succumbed to political pressure. But while Jokowi's running mate Ma'ruf might burnish his Muslim credentials, it could also impact the level of support Jokowi receives from more liberal voters. Amahl Sharif Azwar, a gay Indonesian freelance writer who lives in Thailand, voted for Jokowi in 2014, but has decided to abstain from this presidential election. The moment he chose Ma'ruf Amin, I decided that enough is enough, Azwar says. I think it's unfair to expect LGBT Indonesians to vote when we're not even considered a part of this nation. Those keen for change are now looking ahead to the 2024 election, when there could be a host of new faces. It's a story that's been told before in politics. Like Jokowi, Obama also faced criticism during his second election bid, especially from former supporters who had expected more change during his first term. Most leaders who rise to power on a wave of hope end up disappointing their supporters when confronted with the realities of government, said Bland. It was inevitable that the shine would come off Jokowi.","['Ed Wray Getty Images', 'Getty Images', 'Joko Widodo', 'Jokowi', 'Joko Widodo', 'Barack Obama']","['Joko', 'Widodo', 'Barack', 'Obama.', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Joko', 'Widodo,', 'Joko', 'Widodo', 'Ben', 'Bland,', 'Lowy', 'Ella', 'Prihatini,', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Vedi', 'Hadiz,', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', ""Ma'ruf"", 'Amin', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Amahl', 'Sharif', 'Obama']",[],"['Wray', 'Getty', 'Images', 'AsiaPac', 'Getty', 'United', 'States,', 'Joko', 'Ulet', 'Ifansasti', 'Getty', 'Images', 'AsiaPac', 'Getty', 'Ulet', 'Ifansasti', 'Getty', 'Images', 'AsiaPac', 'Getty', 'University', 'of', 'Western', 'Australia.', 'During', 'Melbourne', 'University.', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi']",[],"['Jakarta', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'Jakarta']","['Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia']","[""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia""]",[],[],"[""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia"", ""Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia""]","Ed Wray Getty Images AsiaPac Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, gives a speech to supporters at a rally at Jakarta's main stadium on April 13, 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Like the former president of the United States, Joko known as Jokowi was a unlikely political outsider who promised change.

Prabowo's choice to move away from his reconciliation approach that he had applied on a consistent basis in his two earlier debates with Jokowi to adopting an offensive one is a common move, taking into account the fact that he is in the opposition, Vishnu Juwono noted in his statement to ANTARA here on Monday.While responding to how the two presidential candidates fared in their latest debate, Juwono, a renowned lecturer of UI's Administration Science Department, highlighted the fact that Subianto, being in the opposition, was essentially looking for loopholes in the government.The strategy shift by Subianto, the incumbent president's opponent, in debating against Jokowi during the recent debate can also be perceived as an attempt to take to task the government over its policies in a bid to increase his support base, according to Juwono.The Subianto Sandiaga Uno pair believe that this new stance would erode Jokowi's electability. Several pollsters, have, in fact, pointed to the fact this pair's electability slipped behind that of the Jokowi Ma'ruf Amin pair, he noted.Subianto's endeavors to take the Jokowi government by the horns over its policies can partly be seen while the pairs clashed in the debate over matters relating to security and defence, as well as international relations, Jowono pointed out.At the recent debate held at the Shangri La Hotel, Central Jakarta, on Saturday evening Mar 30 , Subianto reiterated the point that Indonesia's defense capability was still vulnerable and weak. The presidential candidate number 02 was also vocal in his criticism that Indonesia was lagging behind in terms of its primary weaponry defense system Alutsista , he stated.Subianto was also quick at raising a finger at Jokowi over Indonesia's peace diplomacy and role in finding solutions to the human rights abuses targeting the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar if adequate defense capabilities were not in place to support Jakarta's efforts.He viewed that Indonesia's low defense capability conciliates its bargaining stance while facing powerful states.At the presidential debate that brought up issues concerning ideology, administration, defence, and security, as well as international relations, Jokowi and Subianto debated on ways to solve several existing problems.Juwono cited as an example that in cases involving unjust promotion in bureaucracy, which elements of the bureaucratic reform programs needed improvement.Another point worth noting were the kind of implications that the recent mass killings of Muslims in Chrischurch City, New Zealand, in which three Indonesians were also among those affected by the terror attack, have on the Indonesian foreign policy.Jowono questioned in what way would Indonesia's defense related policies respond to China's rise as a military power and its repercussions on most ASEAN members.","['Jokowi', 'Prabowo Subianto', 'Joko Widodo

candidates fared in their latest debate, Juwono, a renowned lecturer of UI's Administration Science Department, highlighted the fact that Subianto, being in the opposition, was essentially looking for loopholes in the government.The strategy shift by Subianto, the incumbent president's opponent, in debating against Jokowi during the recent debate can also be perceived as an attempt to take to task the government over its policies in a bid to increase his support base, according to Juwono.The Subianto Sandiaga Uno pair believe that this new stance would erode Jokowi's

Unofficial results from private pollsters based on vote samples from Wednesday s election pointed to a comfortable win for Widodo, with about 55 percent of the popular vote, giving him a lead of almost 10 percentage points over his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto. The counts from reputable pollsters have proved to be accurate in previous elections, though the official result will not be announced until May 22. Widodo told reporters he had received congratulatory calls from 22 state leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he had invited his rival to meet. Widodo also urged supporters to wait for official results to confirm the win. At a separate news conference just minutes after Widodo declared victory, Prabowo appeared defiant and said his team had evidence of cheating and claimed to have won 62 percent of the popular vote based on internal polling. We have declared victory because we got evidence of widespread cheating at the village, sub district and district levels across Indonesia, he said, standing next to his running mate, Sandiaga Uno, who looked more subdued. In 2014, Prabowo had also claimed victory on election day, before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo s win. A spokesman for Praboow said he would take his complaint to the Constitutional Court if the Election Commission confirmed Widodo s victory. The commission said earlier on its website Widodo had secured about 50 percent of the vote, based on results from 808 of more than 800,000 polling stations, with Prabowo on about 45 percent. The English language Jakarta Post newspaper carried a front page headline declaring Five More Years next to a picture of the president. Financial markets surged early on Thursday on Widodo s apparent victory, though gains were pared in the afternoon. The rupiah currency ended the day up 0.3 percent from the previous close, and the Jakarta stock index at one point up 2.4 percent closed 0.4 percent higher.

REUTERS Edgar Su NO CASE Alexander Raymond Arifianto, a political analyst at the S.

But he noted risks that Islamist supporters of the challenger, including the hardline Alumni 212 movement, could hit the streets to dispute the election. So Prabowo has no case, but the hardliners and Alumni 212 can create lots of headaches for Jokowi if they go ahead with their protest plan tomorrow and in future weeks, he said, referring to president by his nickname.

The Home Ministry has set a target of the upcoming elections participation rate will reach at least 77.5 percent of the total number of eligible voters that, according to the General Elections Commission KPU , will reach at least 192 million. This targeted participation rate is higher than that of the 2009 and 2014 general elections, which was recorded at 71 and 74 percents respectively. Indonesia experienced a high participation rate in the 2004 general elections, which was recorded at 84 percent. Considering the importance of this participation rate, Tjahjo Kumolo warned that the key of success in convening the upcoming general elections lies in it. Therefore, this issue really matters in this year s elections, Tjahjo Kumolo told the attendees of the police and military s coordinated meeting in Jakarta on Monday. In obtaining this targeted participation rate, the Ministry of Home Affairs had prepared strategies by ensuring that the first time voters who had yet to get their electronic identification cards could cast their votes in ballot booths. The first time voters position seems to be important to help increase the participation rate because their number is relatively high. According to the Home Affairs Ministry s Directorate General of Population and Civil Registration Agency, there have been 5,035,887 first time voters who would be 17 years old on January 1, 2018 up to April 17, 2019. To make sure that these first time voters were able to participate in the upcoming elections, the Home Ministry s officials had make various efforts, including coming to schools, university campuses, and Islamic boarding schools to register them for ID cards. Tjahjo Kumolo revealed that his ministry has initiated to help register these first time voters ID cards by coming to their schools. The ministry s efforts to increase the participation rate were also made through such strategies as voter education and media campaigns, as well as setting holiday on voting day. Apart from the Home Ministry s endeavor to ensure that all eligible voters, including more than five million millennials who will become the first time voters, can cast their votes, those belonging to the Golput need also be anticipated. In minimizing their number, the Indonesian Ulema Council s MUI Advisory Body has called on Muslims all over the country to avoid Golput, an abbreviation for White Group, or those abstaining from voting in the upcoming general elections. Instead, all Muslims who are eligible voters are encouraged to come to the polling stations on April 17, 2019, because leadership is an important matter in Islam, KH Hasan Abdullah Sahal, a member of the council s advisory body, stated recently. The leadership cannot be left behind. Therefore, please do not abstain from voting. Belonging to the Golput means that someone is ignorant. This behavior is not justifiable, he noted, adding that Islam teaches its followers to become responsible people. Abstaining from casting votes in the elections shows ignorance that would only bring about regret and disappointment. Hence, all Muslims in Indonesia are urged to use their voting rights in the upcoming elections. The upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections were not merely regarded as a feisty of democracy, but were also perceived as a mandate of leadership of the people. Taking the significance of this democratic process into account, the Muslim community members, who have rights to vote, are required to exercise their voting rights. Hasan Abdullah Sahal also warned that having different political preferences were acceptable in democracy. Therefore, the community members should be mature enough to face the differences and must not be easily provoked. Do not let the event, which is just held once in five years, damage and put our everlasting brotherhood at risk, he explained. Former Constitutional Court Justice Mahfud MD also echoed the similar message when speaking at at a public lecture of the Mataram State University Unram on increasing the quality of democracy through simultaneous elections on Feb 12. Mahfud urged members of Unram s academic community to maintain peace and cast their votes in the upcoming general elections because the eligible voters were given opportunities to select their favorable members of parliament and a new pair of president and vice president. In this chairman of the Nationhood Torch Movement s point of view, the eligible voters had rights to have different political preferences. In elections, having different choices is acceptable. But, all should accept those who have been elected. However, the winners should not be abusive, while the losers must not be disruptive. Instead, the entire nation should work together to preserve the existence of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia as a God s gift. Apart from the fact that democracy was not an ideal system of government, it was the best of all existing systems at the moment, Mahfud, who is also a member of the Agency for the Implementation of State Ideology of Pancasila BPIP , said.

Around 193 million people were scheduled to vote in presidential, legislative and regional elections last Wednesday 17 04 at more than 813,000 polling stations, making it the most complex single day election in the world. For most of the workers, it was arguably the hardest task of their lives. Over a span of 24 hours, they had to be on full alert to set up and prepare voting booths, hold the election, count and recount thousands of ballots, and report the results accurately to the General Elections Commission KPU . They could not afford to rest, as the slightest deviation from regulations would land them in prison. They barely closed their eyes and sleeping was impossible. For some workers, the stress and fatigue were too much to handle. Their bodies gave up and they simply collapsed. A moment later they were gone.

Antara Photo Puspa Perwitasari Jakarta. Korsa, or common loyalty shared by members of a specific group, apparently does matter and plays an important role in political communications in Indonesia, especially when one presidential candidate is a former military strongman. Political tensions have risen in the world's third largest democracy since last week's election, especially after several pollsters released quick count results showing a win for the incumbent, Joko Jokowi Widodo, and his running mate Ma'ruf Amin. The losing side, Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno immediately rejected the quick count results, accusing their rivals of having cheated in the election by leveraging Jokowi's status as incumbent president to sway the neutrality of government agencies, civil servants, the police and even the election organizer and election watchdog. While Prabowo's attitude may not be surprising, as it took him several months to accept the official result in the 2014 presidential election, this time he has repeatedly declared victory based on his camp's internal data, while also threatening people power or mass mobilization of his supporters. The General Elections Commission KPU is meanwhile expected to only announce the official result after May 22. These threats from Prabowo's side have raised concerns from many, including the political elite, fearing that such action could damage national unity. Enter the Envoy Jokowi's camp also did not stand still. On Thursday last week, a day after the April 17 election, the president said he would send an envoy to Prabowo's camp. While Jokowi was elusive about the identity of this person at the time, Prabowo's camp, through his younger brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo, has since leaked the information, saying Jokowi's man for the job is Luhut Binsar Panjaitan. Many may agree that the one person in Jokowi's camp who could dare use military esprit de corps to reach out to Prabowo, an Army general during the authoritarian regime of President Suharto, it would be Luhut, who certainly has the clout and gravitas to do so. Luhut was Prabowo's senior in the military, and according to tradition, a junior must always respect a senior. Both began their military careers in the Special Forces Command Kopassus . While Luhut was commander of Detachment 81 Counter Terrorism in the early 1980s, Prabowo was his deputy. Prabowo's supporters made cynical comments about the news on Saturday, saying the Great Indonesia Movement Party Gerindra chairman was unlikely to meet Luhut, as he is still busy monitoring the KPU's vote recapitulation and mobilizing his supporters across the nation to keep a close eye on proceedings. Until tonight, Mr. Prabowo has yet to decide whether to meet Jokowi's envoy, Mr. Luhut, at the Kertanegara house, Dahnil Anzar Simanjuntak, spokesman for the candidate pair's national campaign team, tweeted on Saturday night, referring to Prabowo's family residence in South Jakarta. On Monday, Luhut broke the ice by claiming that he had called Prabowo, who has run as a candidate in three presidential elections since 2004. I have called Prabowo we spoke on the phone. Yes, we are friends. We had a good conversation. We had a laugh together and yes, we have set an appointment for a meeting, Luhut told reporters at the Presidential Office in Central Jakarta. He was asked by several journalists about Jokowi appointing him to meet with Prabowo. Luhut, who served as chief security minister under Jokowi between July 2015 and July 2016 and who is now coordinating minister of maritime affairs, said on Sunday that he intended to meet Prabowo. However, he said at that time that Prabowo was suffering from the flu and that the meeting had to be rescheduled. He has not confirmed when he would meet Prabowo. I will call him again. We used to call each other. Prabowo is a good man. I want to convey that over the phone, we had a good conversation. We laughed and had a nostalgic chat about the past, then we set an appointment to meet and have a meal together, Luhut said. He added that he could possibly meet Prabowo on Tuesday. To be honest, we didn't want to reveal this to the public, but because my role as envoy has become public knowledge, well, why don't I reveal it now he said. Hashim has confirmed that his elder brother had not been available to meet with Luhut due to his health. Let's wait until he recovers, because Mr. Prabowo is not feeling well, Hashim told foreign media on Monday. Japanese Food Rising political tensions over the weekend, triggered by Prabowo's defiance and his camp's plans to launch mass action across Indonesia have prompted a kneejerk reaction from investors. The Indonesia Stock Exchange IDX closed 1.4 percent lower on Monday, after local investors dumped stocks in consumer goods companies, including cigarette maker Gudang Garam and soap producer Unilever Indonesia. But Luhut said he was confident that he could get Prabowo to have a rational discussion and thus reduce political tensions. The Prabowo I know is a very rational person and is able to think clearly. I really want Prabowo's legacy to be as a leader who helped develop Indonesia's democracy, he said. Luhut also sent a warning to those around Prabowo to not feed their patron with false information. Prabowo has a high sense of patriotism he is a statesman. He never wants to destroy this country with a wrong decision, he said. When asked where the meeting would likely take place, Luhut said they agreed to have Japanese food. Sticking to Their Guns However, Fadli Zon, Prabowo's right hand man and deputy chairman of Gerindra, expressed skepticism about the meeting yielding tangible results. What for I have no idea. I think it's about concentrating the votes. Political lobbying can be done at another time, said Fadli, who also deputy speaker of the House of Representatives. We are winning. There are thousands of examples of Prabowo winning and evidence of fraud on social media. The state does not want to take action, Fadli said. What is there to talk about What is there to discuss The election is not over. The fraud has to be dealt with, he added.","['Luhut Binsar', 'Prabowo Subianto', 'Joko', 'Jokowi', 'Widodo', 'Puspa Perwitasari Jakarta']","['Luhut', 'Binsar', 'Joko', 'Jokowi', 'Prabowo', 'Subianto', 'Jokowi', 'Luhut', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Luhut,', 'Jokowi', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Hashim', 'Luhut', 'Prabowo', 'Hashim', 'Luhut', 'Luhut', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Luhut', 'Fadli']",['Maritime Affairs'],"['Antara', 'Photo', 'Puspa', 'Perwitasari', 'Jakarta.', 'Sandiaga', 'Uno', 'General', 'Elections', 'Commission', 'KPU', 'Luhut', 'Binsar', 'Panjaitan.', 'Many', 'Army', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Command', 'Kopassus', 'Great', 'Indonesia', 'Movement', 'Party', 'Gerindra', 'Presidential', 'Office', 'Jokowi', 'The', 'Indonesia', 'Stock', 'Exchange', 'IDX', 'Unilever', 'House', 'of', 'Representatives.']",[],"['so.', 'Luhut', 'South', 'Jakarta.', 'Central', 'Jakarta.', 'Prabowo', 'Indonesia']",[],"[""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election"", ""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election"", ""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election"", ""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election"", ""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election"", ""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election""]","[""Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election""]",[],[],"Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, right, has been tasked with establishing a line of communication between his former subordinate, Prabowo Subianto, and President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, following last week's divisive election.

The campaign period for the 2019 legislative and presidential elections is from September 2018 until April 13, 2019.

Convicted terrorist Abu Bakar Ba'asyir is set for release from prison after receiving a pardon from President Joko Jokowi Widodo in a widely perceived political move ahead of the 2019 presidential election. Jokowi said the decision to set Ba'asyir free was based on humanitarian grounds, especially considering the terror convict's health and advanced age. First, it's based on humanitarian reasons. He is old and his current health was also included in our consideration, Jokowi said on Friday, according to a report by state run news agency Antara. However, the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform ICJR questioned the legal basis of Ba'asyir's unconditional release. According to the Jakarta based organization, existing regulations only permit either a conditional release, clemency or amnesty in such cases. A 2012 government regulation on the rights of inmates and a 2018 regulation by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights on the conditions for prisoners to receive sentence reductions and pardons, early release is only permitted under certain requirements, which include specific terms for terror convicts. There does not yet appear to be a legal basis for Ba'asyir's release, and so far, humanitarian grounds have been the only reason repeatedly cited by the president and people close to the matter. Stanislaus Riyanta, a terrorism analyst and postgraduate student from the University of Indonesia, questioned Ba'asyir's unconditional release and warned that a significant potential threat could arise from this. The government's decision to unconditionally release Ba'asyir is very odd, as Ba'asyir is a very influential terror convict especially considering that he has openly refused to adhere to Pancasila, Stanislaus said in a statement, referring to Indonesia's official state ideology. He added that the government should instead pay more attention to victims of terrorism. Ba'asyir, 81, is the spiritual leader of Al Qaeda affiliated Jemaah Islamiyah, which was responsible for the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people. He also founded the terrorist group Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid and had pledged alliance to the Islamic State. He has so far served eight years of the 15 year prison term he received in 2011 for funding a paramilitary camp in Aceh. In March last year, Jokowi approved his transfer to a state hospital in Central Jakarta from Gunung Sindur Prison in Bogor, West Java, due to his deteriorating health. Sidney Jones, a counterterrorism expert and director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict IPAC , criticized Jokowi's decision in an article for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, saying that the government's decision was misguided, legally questionable and politically inept. It sends the message that if one defies the state long enough, it will eventually capitulate. It emboldens those who see democracy as incompatible with Islam, because that's what Ba'asyir has been arguing all his life, Jones wrote. Ba'asyir was not granted house arrest last year, with officials explaining at the time that the law did not permit such an arrangement. Jokowi's unprecedented move, therefore, begs the question of why Ba'asyir should be set free without having to fulfill any requirements. Why hasn't he moved to house arrest if he was too infirm to stay in prison He could have been under constant guard, with restrictions on speech and travel. This way, the police will have their hands full trying to monitor his house, Jones said. Ba'asyir had reportedly been unwilling to sign a letter of allegiance to Pancasila, one of the requirements to receive parole after having served two thirds of his prison sentence. After having discussed the matter with his newly appointed legal advisor, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Jokowi decided that it was best to ease the requirements for Ba'asyir's release and allow the convicted terrorist to circumvent the part related to Pancasila. I wondered what if we loosen the requirements Abu Ba'asyir said that if he must adhere to Pancasila, Pancasila is in line with Islam, so why not simply adhere to Islam As he adheres to Islam, Jokowi then gave his approval, said Yusril, who is the chairman of the Crescent Star Party PBB , an Islamic based political party that is seeking the implementation of shariah in Indonesia. The president then instructed Yusril to coordinate Ba'asyir's release with Justice Minister Yasonna Laoly and National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian. But according to Jones, the waiver, even for humanitarian reasons, makes no sense. Ba'asyir's lawyer, Muhammad Mahendradatta, said during a press conference on Saturday that there was nothing political about his client's pardon. This is a legal matter, and not a political one. It's a gift. This is separate from anything political I reject such claims, Mahendradatta said, as quoted by Antara. However, in her piece for the Lowy Institute piece, Jones raised an important question why now She highlighted that Ba'asyir's health is the same now as it was a year ago, when Jokowi had ignored petitions for his release. At a news conference in Jakarta on Monday, Chief Security Minister Wiranto said the government was still considering several aspects, including Pancasila, before granting Ba'asyir's release, per the request of his family members. The president said we must not be hasty and should consider all relevant aspects, Wiranto told reporters. On Tuesday, Jokowi reiterated that his decision to grant Ba'asyir an early release was based on humanitarian grounds. It will be a release on parole ... with terms and conditions that must be fulfilled, he said, as quoted in a press release. The president gave assurances that allegiance to Pancasila and the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia were among the conditions that could not be disregarded. Jokowi Urged to Also Pardon Other Convicts As the president's decision was based on humanitarian reasons, the ICJR urged him to also grant amnesty to other convicts. The organization said in a statement that Jokowi should commute or overturn the sentences of the 51 inmates who have been on death row for more than 10 years, claiming that being on death row was a form of torture that constituted inhumane treatment. The ICJR added that Baiq Nuril Makmun and Meiliana should also be granted amnesty. Nuril was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in November last year for defaming her alleged sexual harasser, while Meiliana was jailed for blasphemy in August last year for complaining about the volume of the adzan, or Islamic call to prayer, coming from the loudspeakers of a mosque near her home in Tanjung Balai, North Sumatra. Theirs highlight criminal cases that suppress freedom of expression and opinion, as well as the protection of victims' rights in Indonesia, the ICJR said. The organization added that Jokowi's humanitarian values should also propel him to make changes on the country's archaic blasphemy law.","[""Abu Bakar Ba'asyir"", 'Joko Jokowi Widodo', 'Jokowi', ""Ba'asyir""]","['Abu', 'Bakar', ""Ba'asyir"", 'Joko', 'Jokowi', 'Widodo', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Stanislaus', 'Jamaah', 'Ansharut', 'Tauhid', 'Sidney', 'Jones,', 'Jones', 'wrote.', ""Ba'asyir"", 'Jones', 'Yusril', 'Ihza', 'Mahendra,', 'Jokowi', 'Abu', ""Ba'asyir"", 'Jokowi', 'Yasonna', 'Laoly', 'Tito', 'Karnavian.', 'Jokowi', 'Wiranto', 'Wiranto', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Baiq', 'Nuril', 'Makmun', 'Nuril', 'Meiliana']",[],"['Institute', 'for', 'Criminal', 'Justice', 'Reform', 'ICJR', 'the', 'Ministry', 'of', 'Justice', 'the', 'University', 'of', 'Indonesia,', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'Islamic', 'State.', 'He', 'Gunung', 'Sindur', 'Prison', 'Institute', 'for', 'Policy', 'Analysis', 'of', 'Conflict', 'IPAC', 'Lowy', 'Institute,', 'Crescent', 'Star', 'Party', 'PBB', 'National', 'Police', ""Ba'asyir's"", 'lawyer,', 'Muhammad', 'Mahendradatta,', 'Lowy', 'Institute', 'piece,', 'Jones', 'Unitary', 'State', 'ICJR']",[],"['Jakarta', 'Central', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Pancasila', 'Indonesia', 'Tanjung', 'Balai,', 'North', 'Sumatra.']",['Jakarta'],"["" Convicted terrorist Abu Bakar Ba'asyir is set for release from prison after receiving a pardon from President Joko Jokowi Widodo in a widely perceived political move ahead of the 2019 presidential election"", "" Convicted terrorist Abu Bakar Ba'asyir is set for release from prison after receiving a pardon from President Joko Jokowi Widodo in a widely perceived political move ahead of the 2019 presidential election"", "" Jokowi said the decision to set Ba'asyir free was based on humanitarian grounds, especially considering the terror convict's health and advanced age"", "" Jokowi said the decision to set Ba'asyir free was based on humanitarian grounds, especially considering the terror convict's health and advanced age""]",[],[],['Jakarta'],"Convicted terrorist Abu Bakar Ba'asyir is set for release from prison after receiving a pardon from President Joko Jokowi Widodo in a widely perceived political move ahead of the 2019 presidential election.

Unofficial results from private pollsters based on vote samples from Wednesday s election pointed to a comfortable win for Widodo, with about 55 per cent of the popular vote, giving him a lead of almost 10 percentage points over his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto. READ MORE How India runs the biggest election in the world The counts from reputable pollsters have proved to be accurate in previous elections, though the official result will not be announced until May 22. Widodo told reporters he had received congratulatory calls from 22 state leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he had invited his rival to meet. Widodo also urged supporters to wait for official results to confirm the win. WATCH Indonesian president meets plane crash families as search carries into night At a separate news conference just minutes after Widodo declared victory, Prabowo appeared defiant and said his team had evidence of cheating and claimed to have won 62 per cent of the popular vote based on internal polling. We have declared victory because we got evidence of widespread cheating at the village, sub district and district levels across Indonesia, he said, standing next to his running mate, Sandiaga Uno, who looked more subdued. In 2014, Prabowo had also claimed victory on election day, before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo s win. READ MORE Joko Widodo sworn in as new Indonesian president A spokesman for Praboow said he would take his complaint to the Constitutional Court if the Election Commission confirmed Widodo s victory. The commission said earlier on its website Widodo had secured about 50 per cent of the vote, based on results from 808 of more than 800,000 polling stations, with Prabowo on about 45 per cent. The English language Jakarta Post newspaper carried a front page headline declaring Five More Years next to a picture of the president. Financial markets surged early on Thursday on Widodo s apparent victory, though gains were pared in the afternoon. The rupiah currency ended the day up 0.3 per cent from the previous close, and the Jakarta stock index at one point up 2.4 per cent closed 0.4 per cent higher. No case Alexander Raymond Arifianto, a political analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies RSIS in Singapore, said Widodo s margin of victory meant the opposition did not appear to have a strong case to claim the election was stolen. But he noted risks that Islamist supporters of the challenger, including the hardline Alumni 212 movement, could hit the streets to dispute the election. So Prabowo has no case, but the hardliners and Alumni 212 can create lots of headaches for Jokowi if they go ahead with their protest plan tomorrow and in future weeks, he said, referring to president by his nickname. Novel Bamukmin, a spokesman for Alumni 212, said the movement planned a peaceful march after Friday prayers at Jakarta s Istiqlal mosque. We just want to bow down to express our gratitude in order that this victory is recognized, he said, referring to Prabowo s claim he won the election. Islamist groups have in the past been able to mobilize tens of thousands of supporters. From late 2016, they organized a series of big protests against the Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the first ethnic Chinese Christian to hold the job, who was subsequently jailed for insulting the Koran. Police vowed firm action against any rallies that could disturb security as Prabowo s supporters planned to march in central Jakarta after midday prayers on Friday. I appeal to anyone not to mobilize, whether to mobilize people to celebrate victory or mobilize due to dissatisfaction, said national police chief Tito Karnavian, pledging firm action. At the same news conference, chief security minister Wiranto called for people to avoid any act of anarchy that breaches the law.","['Joko Widodo', 'Prabowo Subianto']","['Joko', 'Widodo', 'Widodo', 'Mahathir', 'Mohamad', 'Widodo', 'Widodo', 'Prabowo', 'Widodo', 'Joko', 'Widodo', 'Praboow', 'Widodo', 'Widodo', 'Prabowo', 'Widodo', 'Alexander', 'Raymond', 'Widodo', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Wiranto']",['Widodo'],"['Election', 'Commission', 'S.', 'Rajaratnam', 'School', 'of', 'International', 'Studies', 'RSIS']",[],"['India', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta', 'Jakarta']",[],"['Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday declared victory in a presidential election to lead the world s third largest democracy but his challenger also claimed he had won and complained of widespread cheating', 'Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday declared victory in a presidential election to lead the world s third largest democracy but his challenger also claimed he had won and complained of widespread cheating']",['Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday declared victory in a presidential election to lead the world s third largest democracy but his challenger also claimed he had won and complained of widespread cheating'],[],[],"Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday declared victory in a presidential election to lead the world s third largest democracy but his challenger also claimed he had won and complained of widespread cheating.

Manado on Sulawesi island is one of the few places that Indonesia's remaining Jews mostly descendants of traders from Europe and Iraq who were once thought to number around several thousand before World War II feel comfortable showing their faith.

It had been the site of anti Israel protests for years, and was sealed off by religious hardliners in 2009 and left to decay. Indonesia has long been praised for its moderate brand of Islam, but more conservative forms of the religion have taken center stage in recent years, driven by increasingly vocal hardline groups. Tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and the Palestinians, spill over here and deepen religious divides. Thousands of hardliners demonstrated in Jakarta when US President Donald Trump announced last year that the American embassy in Israel would be moved to the contested city of Jerusalem. There is still a lot of anti semitic sentiment in Indonesia, Baruch said. Generally speaking, Indonesians don't differentiate between being Jewish and Israel. They think Jews and Israel are the enemy of their religion and state, he added. Rabbi Yaakov Baruch holding a menorah at a synagogue in Tondano, North Sulawesi, March 4, 2019 There is no denying that tolerance is fading in our country. The size of the Jewish community makes it almost invisible so Jews have not been the target of Islamist militants like some of Indonesia's larger religious minorities. A wave of deadly suicide bombings at churches in Surabaya last year highlighted the threat to minority groups, while Shiites and Ahmadis regarded as heretics by some majority Sunni Muslims have also been the target of violence. Still, Indonesia's Jews are on the radar of some groups. Monique Rijkers' efforts to bridge the divide with a TV program about Judaism drew the ire of the Indonesian Muslim Students Association, which she claims reported her to government and broadcast regulators. An Indonesian woman cleaning one of the Jewish tombs at a Christian cemetery in a Muslim majority neighborhood in Jakarta They demanded that I be fired and that the program be cancelled, said Rijkers, founder of Hadassah of Indonesia, a non profit organisation that offers cultural education programs Centered on Israel, Jews and the Holocaust. Indonesia's Jews face some practical challenges, too, such as finding kosher food in a country where it's not widely available. Another hurdle is that Indonesia has long allowed for only six different religious categories on all important ID cards Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism. The cards are crucial for accessing government services, and for doing things such as registering marriages and births, meaning most Jews lie and put Christianity on the documents. Even some Muslim Indonesians learn that taking an interest in anything Jewish can raise eyebrows. Sapri Sale, who started teaching a Hebrew class in Jakarta a year ago, has been studying the language since the 1990s and compiled what he says is the world's first Hebrew Indonesian dictionary. But his interests got little positive feedback at home.

But the latest salvo from Prabowo's camp may have just gone more than a little over the top. Former People s Consultative Assembly chairman and senior opposition leader Amien Rais on Sunday 31 03 threatened to organize a mass protest at the slightest hint of voter fraud during the presidential election, declaring that he will rely on people power to protest rather than going to the Constitutional Court. If fraud happens in the election , we will not go to the Constitutional Court. There is no point. We are people power. People power is legitimate Amien Rais said at the Sunda Kelapa mosque in Central Jakarta. His statement came during a rally dubbed Apel Siaga 313 attended by members of the Indonesian Muslim Forum FUI and Islamic Defenders Front FPI , who marched from the Sunda Kelapa mosque to the nearby General Elections Commission KPU office to call on opposition supporters to closely monitor election proceedings and prevent voter fraud from happening. Constitutional Court spokesman Fajar Laksono said he regretted Amien s remarks. Fajar said Amien s statement might cast doubt on all the work they had put to in to improve public trust on the Constitutional Court and could be considered as contempt of court. He also pointed out that when he was chairman of the People s Consultative Assembly, Amien actually took part in establishing the Constitutional Court. The Election Supervisory Board Bawaslu considered Amien s plan to mobilize people power as illegitimate. Bawaslu official Rahmat Bagja said the 2017 Election Law stipulates that the Constitutional Court holds the final say on electoral disputes. The law was made and agreed by all factions of the DPR House of Representatives . Every citizen must comply with it, Bagja said. Indonesian Solidarity Party PSI spokesman and legislative candidate Rian Ernest urged Amien to stop adding fuel to the fire in an already heated presidential race. He said that as an icon of the 1998 Reformasi movement, Amien should set an example for the current generation. In the chaotic days before New Order dictator Suharto decided to resign on May 21, 1998, Amien had also threatened to stage a one million strong people power demonstration at the National Monument in Jakarta, before a warning from the army that the protest may turn into Indonesia's own Tiananmen massacre forced him to shelf the plan. Political elites must set an example. Besides, Amien is not only part of the political elite but was also part of the Reformasi movement. Political elites must set an example instead of playing the provocateur, Rian said on Monday. He said people power had been used to overthrow dictators in other countries, but that Indonesia, however, is not a dictatorship. Who has the potential of becoming a dictator That person may be who Amien is defending and supporting, Rian said. Rian said Amien's statement was part of the opposition's strategy to weaken public trust of state apparatuses, but he was convinced that Prabowo will not support it. I am sure Prabowo is a statesman who competes fairly, unlike what Amien has been trying to do with his comments, he said. In the 2014 presidential election, which also matched up Jokowi against Prabowo, quick counts showed a clear victory for the former, but Prabowo's camp called the results unconstitutional and demanded a recount. They launched an official challenge at the Constitutional Court, but the lawsuit was rejected and the court declared the election free of any fraud. Today, Prabowo is still trailing Jokowi by a double digit gap in the polls. A poll by Indo Barometer put support for Jokowi and his running mate, cleric Ma ruf Amin, at 51 percent and for Prabowo and his billionaire running mate Sandiaga Uno at 32 percent among likely voters. The poll was conducted between March 15 and 21, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. The Indonesian Survey Circle LSI also put Jokowi in the driving seat ahead of the election. 1,200 respondents for a poll conducted between March 18 and 26, turn out support for Jokowi at 56.8 63.2 percent and for Prabowo at 36.8 43.2 percent a 20 percent lead for the incumbent president.","['Joko Jokowi Widodo', 'Prabowo Subianto']","['Joko', 'Jokowi', 'Widodo', 'Prabowo', 'Subianto', 'Amien', 'Rais', 'Amien', 'Rais', 'Fajar', 'Laksono', 'Fajar', 'Amien', 'Rahmat', 'Bagja', 'Rian', 'Ernest', 'Suharto', 'Amien', 'Rian', 'Rian', 'said.', 'Rian', 'Prabowo', 'Prabowo', 'Amien', 'Jokowi', 'Jokowi', 'Prabowo', 'Jokowi']",['Prabowo'],"['top.', 'Former', 'People', 's', 'Consultative', 'Assembly', 'Islamic', 'Defenders', 'Front', 'FPI', 'General', 'Elections', 'Commission', 'KPU', 'happening.', 'Constitutional', 'Court', 'Constitutional', 'Court', 'People', 's', 'Consultative', 'Assembly,', 'Amien', 'Election', 'Supervisory', 'Board', 'Bawaslu', 'Constitutional', 'Court', 'DPR', 'House', 'of', 'Representatives', 'Bagja', 'said.', 'Indonesian', 'Solidarity', 'Party', 'PSI', 'National', 'Monument', 'Reformasi', 'movement.', 'Political', 'Prabowo', 'Ma', 'ruf', 'Sandiaga', 'Uno', 'LSI', 'Jokowi', 'Prabowo']",[],"['Sunda', 'Kelapa', 'Central', 'Jakarta.', 'Sunda', 'Kelapa']","['Indonesia', 'Jakarta']","["" With only two weeks left until Indonesia's presidential election on April 17, it is only natural for supporters of both presidential nominees current president Joko Jokowi Widodo and his rival, ex army general Prabowo Subianto to ramp up their rhetoric"", "" With only two weeks left until Indonesia's presidential election on April 17, it is only natural for supporters of both presidential nominees current president Joko Jokowi Widodo and his rival, ex army general Prabowo Subianto to ramp up their rhetoric""]","["" But the latest salvo from Prabowo's camp may have just gone more than a little over the top""]",[],"["" With only two weeks left until Indonesia's presidential election on April 17, it is only natural for supporters of both presidential nominees current president Joko Jokowi Widodo and his rival, ex army general Prabowo Subianto to ramp up their rhetoric"", 'Jakarta']","With only two weeks left until Indonesia's presidential election on April 17, it is only natural for supporters of both presidential nominees current president Joko Jokowi Widodo and his rival, ex army general Prabowo Subianto to ramp up their rhetoric.

The military operation was launched after the December 2 brutal killing of PT Istaka Karya employees by the West Papua National Liberation Army TPNPB who were working on the Trans Jakarta highway bridge. Nduga Case Investigation Team member Theo Hasegem said that the military operations have resulted in many deaths and deep trauma among Nduga communities. The independent team, which went to the area found alleged HAM violations as a concequence of the military operations , said Hasegem at the Amnesty International Indonesia office in the Menteng suburb of Central Jakarta on Friday March 29. Hasegem explained that the investigation found that a number of local people s homes and public facilities such as community healthcare centres puskesmas were intentionally torched by TNI personnel during the operations. They the team also suspect that military forces dropped bombs using helicopters during air attacks in a number of districts , said Hasegem. In addition to this, Hasegem said that many local people were forced to flee their homes to seek safety in refugee shelters spread across several districts. He stated that people were worried about falling victim to the operations. Displaced people According to the investigation team s data, tens of thousands of Nduga residents have fled as a result of the operations. A detailed breakdown found that there were 4,276 displaced people in Mapenduma district, 4,369 in Mugi district, 5,056 in Jigi district, 5,021 in Yal district and 3,775 people in Mbulmu Yalma district. Not only that, there are 4,238 displaced people are spread across Kagayem district, 2,982 in Nirkuri district, 4,001 in Inikgal district, 2,021 in Mbua district and 1.704 in Dal district. Hasegem stated that the conditions at the refugee shelters are quite inhuman because many mothers gave birth in the forests because of difficulties accessing medical assistance. The investigation team also saw many malnourished infants at refugee shelters because there is inadequate food. Several civilians have even died while in the refugee shelters , he said. And the suffering of the people in Nduga doesn t end there. Hasegem said that they found civilians in several villages that had suffered at the hands of security forces and subsequently died. He cited two school children who were shot dead in Mbua district and several civilians who suffered gunshot wounds and were left to die. Moreover the whereabouts of Reverend Geyimin Nirigi is still not known by his family. It is suspected that the reverend was abducted by military personnel in Mapenduma district , he said Reevaluate operation Looking at the situation, Hasegem is asking the Indonesian government to reevaluate the ongoing military operations in Nduga. He stated that the operation will result in many more victims if it is allowed to continue. We are urging the government and the DPR House of Representatives to conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the placement of security personnel in the context of finding a solution , said Hasegem. Hasegem is of the view that a security approach is not the appropriate solution to resolve the problems in Nduga and feels concerned that the operations will result in continuing human rights violations in Papua. Hasegem is proposing that the government instead prioritise dialogue as was the experience in dealing with the Free Aceh Movement GAM in 2005. We suggest that the government and the DPR use the important experience of Aceh, when dialogue was carried out facilitated by a neutral party , he said. rzr pmg Translated by James Balowski.

Reasonable people can and do disagree as to how much governments should regulate these activities. However, because many of these morality laws are based on Sharia, some local Muslim groups filed a formal complaint with the police, claiming Natalie had insulted the Quran. If Indonesian police decide to formally charge her with blasphemy, she could face up to five years in prison. Two years ago, Meiliana, an ethnic Chinese Buddhist woman from North Sumatra, remarked to an acquaintance about the volume of a loudspeaker on a nearby mosque. This comment sparked a riot that destroyed at least 14 Buddhist temples and, as of August, landed her in prison for 18 months for blasphemy. After she was convicted, the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs issued guidelines on the use of mosque loudspeakers, suggesting her comments were not unreasonable or insulting. Interreligious Tensions Indonesia s Criminal Code prohibits expression or acts at enmity with, abusing, or staining a religion adhered to in Indonesia. While intended to prevent conflict, this provision has, in practice, exacerbated interreligious tensions. Instead of encouraging Indonesians of all faiths to respect each other, the code has given license to hardliners to attack people from other religious traditions for innocuous or offhand comments. Even more troubling, hardline opportunists increasingly wield the blasphemy law against political opponents. In December 2016, a coalition of groups staged massive protests against Jakarta governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, after he allegedly said that the Quran misled Muslims by forbidding them from voting for a Christian. In April 2017, Ahok lost his bid for reelection, and a month later he was sentenced to two years imprisonment for blasphemy. Fortunately, the government reduced his sentence and released Ahok from prison on January 24. Human Cost of Blasphemy Law Indonesia s reforms since 1998 have earned it widespread praise as a successful Muslim democracy, including from Vice President Mike Pence. Unfortunately, democracy also brought pressure on the government to accommodate hardliners who want to intimidate religious minorities. The current president, Joko Jokowi Widodo, has tried to resist, but 23 people have been sentenced in blasphemy cases since he took office in 2014, according to Human Rights Watch. And just eight weeks ago, the Jakarta Prosecutor s Office released a mobile phone app that allows users to report instances of religious heresy. The Indonesian government should abolish the blasphemy law which has been used to imprison 150 people since 1968 including 6 in 2018 most of them from minority communities. https t.co gvasP9ueUD Elaine Pearson PearsonElaine January 24, 2019 In October, a delegation from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom USCIRF , on which we serve as Commissioners, visited Indonesia. We learned about the human cost of Indonesia s blasphemy law when we met with a local activist who was helping Meiliana and others accused under the law. Tolerance Although we were dismayed to hear about the persecutions, we were heartened to encounter many Indonesians who were genuinely committed to religious pluralism. They not only tolerated other religions but took pride in providing moral and even financial support to them. After a group of suicide bombers attacked three churches in Surabaya in May, Muslims from a neighboring community offered their condolences and helped clean the debris. Nahdlatul Ulama with an estimated 40 million members one of the world s largest Muslim organizations has criticized Meiliana s conviction, stating outright that her remarks did not constitute blasphemy. In USCIRF s 2018 Annual Report, we placed Indonesia on our Tier 2 countries that meet at least one of three criteria of systematic, egregious, or ongoing violations for tolerating or engaging in serious violations of religious freedom, including blasphemy law enforcement. Last year, we issued a report analyzing blasphemy laws around the world and found Indonesia s vaguely worded and imposed penalties harsher than average for such laws. Defining Blasphemy Indonesia has the right and indeed the duty under domestic and international law to prevent religious conflict. Balancing freedom of speech and religious tolerance is difficult for many countries, including the United States. Yet, we came away from our visit convinced that Indonesia s current blasphemy law, especially as applied, does more harm than good. We hope Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo use the good relationships they have built with Indonesian political and religious leaders to call for the repeal of the blasphemy law. At the very least, the Indonesian government should amend the law to more precisely define blasphemy, to reduce the penalties, and to ensure that people like Natalie Grace and Meiliana are not severely punished for offhand comments.

Absenteeism, better known as Golput the White Group in Indonesia, has a deep root in resistance movements against the Suharto dictatorship, and had been on the rise since Indonesia held its first direct presidential election in 2004. 25 percent of voters went Golput in 2004 and the number went up to 28 percent in 2009.

AP Photo Dita Alangkara About 193 million Indonesians are eligible to vote Wednesday in presidential and legislative elections. Widodo, who narrowly defeated Subianto in the 2014 election, is Indonesia's first president from outside the Jakarta elite. Subianto is an establishment figure from a wealthy family who was a special forces general during the Suharto dictatorship that ended amid social and economic chaos in 1998. Subianto's running mate, Sandiaga Uno, told a crowd of thousands in Tangerang that a government led by them would focus on ensuring Indonesians had good jobs and a lower cost of living. We will be able to unite the country and make this country very strong, said Uno, a businessman who has spent more than 100 million on the campaign. Subianto supporter Akhirudin Konsi said he wants a president who will fight for our rights and stand behind people, who will lower prices, especially education, fuel and basic needs. Polls show Widodo has maintained a big lead over Subianto for months, but some analysts say the race is tighter than it appears. Businessman Sahala Panjaitan said he and four family members came to Jakarta for Widodo's rally from Pontianak in West Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo. We came from across the island because we want to show that Jokowi's support was far greater, Panjaitan said. He is the nation's best son.

We have set a target of reducing our poverty rate to the level of 8.5 to 9.5 percent. If we still find that the last figure stays at 9.66 percent, we hope it would be recorded at the level of nine percent at the end of 2019, he remarked. To achieve the target, the government will focus on strengthening its social aid services for appropriate and eligible recipients, including the non cash food assistance program BPNT and Indonesian Health Cards KIS , he explained. The targeted recipients of programs, such as the BNPN, KIS, Family Hope Program PKH , and the Indonesian Smart Cards KIP , are those belonging to the list of extreme poverty. Those vulnerable to falling into the poverty line will be economically empowered by offering access to microfinance and by creating more jobs, Brodjonegoro stated. The Central Statistics Agency BPS recorded that Indonesia s poverty rate tends to decrease. In March 2018, the poverty rate reached 9.82 percent, but it decreased to 9.66 percent in September 2018. Hence, the BPS noted that the poverty rate reduced around 0.16 percent during the period between March and September 2018 as compared to around 0.46 percent in September 2017, Brodjonegoro noted. As of September 2018, there are still 25.67 million poor people in Indonesia. The total number decreased around 0.28 million people as compared to that of March 2018 and around 0.91 million people than that of September 2017. Brodjonegoro further revealed that the levels of inequality in society were brought about by access to infrastructure and basic services as well as social aid services for appropriate and eligible recipients.

Indonesian forces have poured into Nduga since rebels killed 19 people working on the trans Papua highway on Dec. 2. The government of President Joko Widodo says the highway will speed up economic development of West Papua and Papua provinces, among the poorest regions in Indonesia, but independence supporters see the project as a way for Jakarta to cement control over the region. An insurgency has simmered in Papua, which makes up the western half of the island of New Guinea, since the early 1960s when Indonesia annexed the Dutch controlled territory. Discrimination against indigenous Papuans and abuses by Indonesian police and military have drawn renewed attention globally as Indonesia campaigns for membership in the U.N.'s human rights watchdog.

They said 25 civilians have died as a result of military and police security operations in Nduga since the Dec. 2 attack. Indonesia replied that security forces are trying to be very selective and cautious in the attempt to bring all perpetrators of the heinous killing on Dec. 2 to justice. The military says civilian workers on the highway have fled and its engineers will build the 21 bridges needed to complete it.

Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry has summoned Vietnam's ambassador to Indonesia Pham Vinh Quang to explain an incident involving an Indonesian Navy war ship and two Vietnamese coastguard boats in the Natuna Sea last weekend, the ministry said on Monday. On Saturday, Indonesian Navy war ship KRI Tjiptadi 381 was involved in a tense skirmish with two Vietnamese coastguard vessels in North Natuna Sea. According to a statement by the Indonesian Navy, the war ship had captured a Vietnamese fishing boat operating illegally on Indonesian waters. The two Vietnamese coastguard boats, identified as KN 264 and KN 213, belonged to Vietnam's Fisheries Department. When KRI Tjiptadi 381 started towing the fishing boat, the Vietnamese coastguard vessel KN 264 hit the war ship, while KN 213 bumped the fishing boat to sink it into the water. Indonesian Navy officers rescued 12 crew from the fishing boat, but another two escaped by jumping into the sea. They were picked up by the Vietnamese coastguards. Rear Admiral Yudo Margono, the commander of the Indonesian Navy s 1st Fleet, said the incident happened within Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone EEZ . Vietnam claimed the skirmish happened on its territorial waters. The Indonesian Navy did not retaliate to the Vietnamese coastguards' provocations. The Vietnamese boat crew were taken to the Ranai Naval Base. They will face a legal process, Admiral Yudo said in a statement.

REUTERS Willy Kurniawan File Photo By Fanny Potkin and Agustinus Beo Da Costa JAKARTA Reuters Armed with laptops, three dozen journalists and fact checkers braced for battle before a live debate between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his challenger, Prabowo Subianto. With two giant screens displaying television network feeds in front of them, the keyboard warriors split into six groups, each responsible for fact checking a segment of the debate. For nearly three hours, their eyes barely left their screens as they attempted to verify candidates' comments in real time allegations about corruption, statistics on the country's Muslim population, boasts, and even personal anecdotes. They and other fact checkers are fighting a running battle against fake news and propaganda ahead of an April 17 election in the world's third biggest democracy. Election monitors are worried that the flow of misinformation stoking ethnic and religious divides could undermine electoral bodies and even raise social tensions. The Cekfakta checkfacts in Indonesian initiative brings together the non profit fact checking organization Mafindo and 24 news organizations that normally compete fiercely with each other during election campaigns. There's a watchdog now in operation, Cekfakta co founder Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor in chief of news website Tempo.co, told Reuters. As a candidate, you cannot throw claims into the air ... we will fact check them. Backed financially by Google News Lab, which also helps fund Mafindo, Cekfakta's volunteers took over the U.S tech giant's swanky Jakarta office for the debate on March 30. Dhyatmika wanted to avoid a repeat of the 2014 election, also between Widodo and retired general Prabowo, when reporters were unprepared for the flood of false news that swept across social media. 'WE'RE IN A WAR' The fact checkers' adversaries, fake news peddlers, sit at screens too, pumping out misinformation disguised as fact that often exploits ethnic or religious divides. We're in a war for content ... people are doing anything they want, said one fake news creator, who has written stories depicting Indonesian officials as paid off by Beijing. The person declined to be identified because such work is illegal. Indonesia's population of 269 million has a youthful median age of just over 30 years, according to the World Population Review. With more than 100 million accounts, the country is Facebook's third largest market and a top five market globally for its platforms WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as rival Twitter. Fake news in Indonesia can rack up thousands of views in hours, despite laws against creating and spreading such content. Mafindo's head of fact checking, Aribowo Sasmito, compares it to the drug trade. There are the factories, the dealers, and the victims. Most of the people who end up arrested are victims ... They read hoaxes and believed them to be true. Since December, Mafindo has documented a surge in political fake news using ethnicity and religion to target both candidates. The organization finds most worrisome the dozens of stories that paint electoral bodies as corrupt. This will be only Indonesia's fourth democratic presidential election. Sasmito considers it a good result if fact checked posts can reach even a small fraction of the audience the originals did. Mafindo's work has made it some enemies. The group has received enough threats that it keeps its office address secret Cefakta's website was hacked after a previous debate. A Reuters investigation in March found that both the Prabowo and Widodo campaigns were funding sophisticated social media operations to spread propaganda and disinformation through fake accounts on behalf of the candidates. L3N20Z2EH Both campaigns said they did not use such teams.

REUTERS Willy Kurniawan File Photo By Fanny Potkin and Agustinus Beo Da Costa JAKARTA Reuters Armed with laptops, three dozen journalists and fact checkers braced for battle before a live debate between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his challenger, Prabowo Subianto.
They and other fact checkers are fighting a running battle against fake news and propaganda ahead of an April 17 election in the world's third biggest democracy.
The Cekfakta checkfacts in Indonesian initiative brings together the non profit fact checking organization Mafindo and 24 news organizations that normally compete fiercely with each other during election campaigns.
Backed financially by Google News Lab, which also helps fund Mafindo, Cekfakta's volunteers took over the U.S tech giant's swanky Jakarta office for the debate on March 30.
Dhyatmika wanted to avoid a repeat of the 2014 election, also between Widodo and retired general Prabowo, when reporters were unprepared for the flood of false news that swept across social media.
'WE'RE IN A WAR' The fact checkers' adversaries, fake news peddlers, sit at screens too, pumping out misinformation disguised as fact that often exploits ethnic or religious divides.
people are doing anything they want, said one fake news creator, who has written stories depicting Indonesian officials as paid off by Beijing.
Fake news in Indonesia can rack up thousands of views in hours, despite laws against creating and spreading such content.
Since December, Mafindo has documented a surge in political fake news using ethnicity and religion to target both candidates.
A Reuters investigation in March found that both the Prabowo and Widodo campaigns were funding sophisticated social media operations to spread propaganda and disinformation through fake accounts on behalf of the candidates.
FAKE NEWS CREATORS One journalist said he was hired by Prabowo campaign advisers to write positive stories about Prabawo and negative ones on Widodo, to be posted on Facebook and WhatsApp. He said he was not motivated by money but believes the mainstream media is biased in favor of Widodo.

A photo she posted late last month, depicting her holding up a sticker saying Saya Golput , was originally intended as harmless self expression. However, what initially began as a declaration of political preference quickly turned into a public referendum on political participation. I honestly didn't know I was going to go viral. I openly declared as an abstainer on Twitter because I could no longer stand the toxic narrative of cebong tadpole and kampret small bat . So I turned to abstention as an alternate narrative and as a form of protest, Ms Lini told The Jakarta Post, while referring to supporters of Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his challenger, Mr Prabowo Subianto, in the coming Indonesian presidential election. Her Twitter page, Lini ZQ, is home to a pinned thread explaining the reasons behind her commitment to abstention, in addition to her controversial photo. At the time of writing, the photo had generated over 2,000 retweets since its posting on Mar 28. In recent weeks, a group of nonvoters has emerged from obscurity to start a campaign advocating abstention as a form of protest against political candidates as the country holds its collective breath for the presidential election on April 17. The movement, dubbed Saya Golput I abstain , has recently become the centre of online discourse surrounding the coming presidential election which pits incumbent candidate Mr Joko against Mr Prabowo. In Indonesian, the term golput can mean abstention. But historically, the word refers to those who came to the polling stations and spoiled the ballots as a political protest against elections under the New Order regime. The hashtag SayaGolput has for weeks served as a proverbial battleground between those who remain steadfast in their voting preferences and those who choose to support neither of the candidates. Lini, who currently serves as an advocacy officer for human rights activist network ASEAN SOGIE Caucus, has been thrust into the forefront of the movement, and eventually helped it gain traction as the rest of the public braced themselves for the coming election. Abstention is a perfectly legitimate option in a scenario where the only available options are candidates who misrepresent the people's aspirations, she said. She pointed to a tweet posted on Mr Joko's official Twitter account as another reason why she had become disillusioned with the coming election. She considered Mr Joko's tweet, which dismisses rumours of legalising LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender as misinformation, to be a deliberate effort to erase the existence of the country's non heterosexual demographic. Now you know why I choose to abstain, SayaGolput. Hello, my queer fellas, you all are hoax sic Ms Lini wrote in reply to Mr Joko's tweet.

Voter turnout in Indonesia has traditionally been high, consistently exceeding 70 per cent for national elections since the end of the Soeharto regime.

In 2014, Mr Joko campaigned on a platform of, among other things, solving past cases of human rights abuse, but activists and experts have criticised the incumbent for a lack of progress on uncovering atrocities committed in the country's past. Meanwhile, ever since the 2014 election, Mr Prabowo's candidacy has raised deep concerns among human rights activists over the candidate's alleged involvement in the kidnapping of pro democracy activists in 1997 and 1998. Those who declared to abstain have provoked strong responses from members of the public. Ms Lini, for instance, has recently come under fire online as many Indonesian netizens have found her views to be disruptive to the election and the country's democracy. Some even went so far as trading ad hominem blows, often openly mocking her for being a radical activist.

Results from private pollsters who counted vote samples from Wednesday's poll point to a comfortable win for Widodo, raising hopes for a splurge of reforms in his second term. The quick counts showed Widodo winning the popular vote with at least 54 percent, giving him a lead of around eight percentage points over former general Prabowo Subianto, who was narrowly defeated by Widodo in the election five years ago. The counts from reputable pollsters have proved to be accurate in previous elections, though the official result will not be announced until May. Prabowo, a former son in law of military strongman Suharto who was overthrown in 1998, said on Wednesday he was not trailing Widodo and believed his share of the vote was in a 52 54 percent range. We have noted several incidents that have harmed the supporters of this ticket, Prabowo said, without giving detail. With Prabowo's supporters planning to march in central Jakarta after midday prayers on Friday, national police chief Tito Karnavian warned against rallies. I appeal to anyone not to mobilise, whether to mobilise people to celebrate victory or mobilise due to dissatisfaction, said Karnavian, pledging firm action. At the same news conference, chief security minister Wiranto called for people to avoid any act of anarchy that breaches the law while waiting for the official election result. In 2014, Prabowo had also claimed victory on election day, before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo's win. Widodo said on Wednesday the results indicated he had regained the presidency of the world's fourth most populous nation, but urged supporters to wait for the election commission to announce official results. 'NO CASE' The front page of Indonesia's English language Jakarta Post newspaper carried the headline Five More Years next to a picture of the president. Financial markets rose before trimming gains with the rupiah currency up 0.3 percent from the previous close and the Jakarta stock index up 0.6 percent by midday. Alexander Raymond Arifianto, a political analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies RSIS in Singapore, said Widodo's margin of victory meant the opposition did not appear to have a strong case to claim the election was stolen. But he noted risks that Islamist supporters of the challenger, including the hardline Alumni 212 movement, could hit the streets to dispute the election. So Prabowo has no case, but the hardliners and Alumni 212 can create lots of headaches for Jokowi if they go ahead with their protest plan tomorrow and in future weeks, he said, referring to president by his nickname. Novel Bamukmin, a spokesman for Alumni 212, said the movement planned a peaceful march after Friday prayers at Jakarta's Istiqlal mosque. We just want to bow down to express our gratitude in order that this victory is recognised, he said, referring to Prabowo's claim he won the election. Islamist groups have in the past been able to mobilise tens of thousands of supporters. From late 2016, they organised a series of big protests against the Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the first ethnic Chinese Christian to hold the job, who was subsequently jailed for insulting the Koran.
