If I were listed as a drug dealer or a convicted criminal, I wouldn t have complained a word for searching my home like that.

Scrawled in red across upperclassmen s chests were the initials ME short for mechanical engineering, the name of their program. King Mongkut students should have more brains than this. You can hold garbage picking activities on the beach, or even just hang out and have fun there and bond, instead of doing brain cell destroying activities such as these, Facebook user Sirasak Fitty Srichan wrote. An Anti Sotus activist who asked for anonymity while the investigation of the recent event is ongoing, said he believes the camp was set up by upperclassmen rather than the university, and that this wasn t an isolated incident just one of which they had proof. People from this school are taught to keep stuff such as this from leaking out of the school, and to do what their roon p said. But there s lots more of it happening, the activist said. Extreme SOTUS activities can prove to be unwelcoming for freshmen. For the upcoming March 24 election, millions of young voters will cast their ballots for the first time.

But Joeking responded We managed to save 38 people.... We saved lives and halted the operations of a syndicate. The establishment of the inquiry was announced in January, several months after a corruption plagued regime was ejected from power by a reformist alliance.

Since most Thai businesses close during the long Songkran holidays, thousands of migrant workers rush back home as the festival is also celebrated in Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. Due to this, the border checkpoint in Tak s Mae Sot district, which sits on the border with Myanmar, was swarming yesterday. People, most of them workers who travelled from Bangkok and other provinces, stood patiently in a queue longer than 300 metres to undergo immigration procedure. While Songkran is usually associated with fun, it has always had a dark side with millions travelling, road accidents and deaths are high during his period. Hence the authorities have launched campaigns, reminding people to be extra careful on roads. This year, the Seven Dangerous Days associated with Songkran began yesterday and will end on April 17. A Dutch tourist was among the fatalities recorded on the first day of the dangerous week, with police saying the accident took place at an intersection in Kanchanaburi s Tha Muang district at 3am.

Thaksin wrote on his Facebook that through the podcast Good Monday , he would share with Thai people every Monday morning how to handle changes in the world. The content will be distilled from his experience of living abroad for 12 years, travelling to many countries both advanced and underdeveloped, as well as meeting numerous political and business leaders, according to the Facebook post. Every Monday, when we wake up, we want to know if our way of making a living is still relevant and if we need to change because the world is changing so fast now, Thaksin wrote. If the sharing of my experiences can be an inspiration to change how you make a living or raise your kids, I will be very happy. In the first episode yesterday, the former PM talked about economic trends this year and the next year that would affect smaller businesses as well as Thai peoples quality of life. The Facebook post garnered nearly 50,000 likes as of press time with over 2,000 comments welcoming the podcast. His official website, displayed in a minimalist style, features four main pages Personal, Business, National Policy, and Good Monday. The website presents photo galleries as well as articles showing his personal life and views on different issues. Following the launch of the podcast, political scientist Sirote Klampaiboon pointed out that Thaksin remained one of the few living Thai ex PMs who remained popular among a section of Thai people. Though some might see him as politically calculating, Thaksin has earned acceptance from the people since he led the now defunct Thai Rak Thai Party in 2001 as a visionary leader, Sirote wrote on Facebook. To demonstrate this again in 2019, Thaksin is showing the people the difference between a visionary leader and a short tempered, narcissistic leader. Another political scientist from Rangsit University, Wanwichit Boonprong, also said that Thaksin was showing his superiority via the podcast, and it would lead to people make comparisons between him and the ruling junta and the pro junta Palang Pracharat Party. This move will force the pro junta camp to come out and criticise the former PM, he said. But at the same time, all eyes would also be on Thaksin and his move via his website and the podcast, he added. Aside from direct competition with the ruling junta, Wanwichit also viewed the launching of the podcast now, with the elections fast approaching, as proof that Thaksin was ready to fight. If some parties or political groups get involved, Wanwichit said they might risk getting dissolved because the charter prohibits outside influence. However, another way to look at it is that Thaksin may want the dissolution to happen to add fuel to the fire. He may expect his supporters to take to the streets and fight the ruling junta, Wanwichit observed.",[],"['Thaksin', 'Sirote', 'Klampaiboon', 'Thaksin', 'Thaksin', 'Thaksin', 'Thaksin', 'Wanwichit', 'Thaksin', 'Wanwichit', 'Thaksin']",[],"['Facebook', 'post.', 'Every', 'Monday,', 'Thai', 'Rak', 'Thai', 'Party', 'Rangsit', 'University,', 'Wanwichit', 'Boonprong,']",[],[],['Thaksin'],[],[],[],['The first podcast in the series was launched yesterday and it could also be viewed on Thaksin s official website thaksinofficial'],"The first podcast in the series was launched yesterday and it could also be viewed on Thaksin s official website thaksinofficial.com.

His latest exhibition Thailand Casino which runs through the March 24 election, takes a hatchet to the junta and the power plays of its nemesis self exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. This election is important... we're gambling as a nation, says Headache, whose jabs at the junta using Bangkok's walls as a canvas have made him a hero of the counter culture. The army took power in 2014, its 12th successful coup in under 100 years, stifling dissent with a series of arrests, threats and special laws. But the lid on dissent has been lifted in the run up to the election. Acerbic memes, blogs and tweets are ricocheting across social media, while chat shows, exhibitions and even t shirts are shaping the conversation, caricaturing the main players in Thailand's political drama. You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. You don't know what's going to happen in the next two months, Headache, who keeps his identity hidden, told AFP at the WTF cafe and gallery. Junta chief Prayut Chan O Cha wants to return to government as a civilian leader. But his foe the self exiled Thaksin stands in his way, buttressed by the enduring electoral pull of his parties. One of those, Thai Raksa Chart, was dissolved by a court on Thursday for proposing Princess Ubolratana as a candidate a bombshell move that was swiftly shot down by her younger brother King Maha Vajiralongkorn. In this picture taken on March 6, 2019, Thai graffiti artist, known as Headache Stencil, poses with his artworks during an exhibition titled 'Thailand Casino' in Bangkok. AFP PHOTO Headache addresses the unprecedented power play with a Chinese calendar marked February 8 the date the princess made her political cameo positioned behind Thaksin's brass head, riven by a lightening strike from above. A golden piggy bank with the face of the junta number two sits in the gallery and cash, casino chips, guns and the word military fund are stencilled across the walls. It's a dystopian vision of a country where army spending is vast and beyond scrutiny.

Read DelayMyAss Thainet Just Can t With Another Election Delay Thailand s last election was annulled by a court in May 2014 on the grounds that voting did not take place on the same day nationwide due to to anti government protesters blocking many voting booths. If this election is voided, we won t have any time frame to hold to anymore. The delay will become a matter of infinity, the activist said. Nuttaa, a leader of the Democracy Restoration Group, said a rally will be held at 5pm on Tuesday at Ratchaprasong Intersection. Protesters also gathered yesterday at the Victory Monument and today at the Election Commission office to deliver their message. The fate of the Feb. 24 election, which seemed set in stone when voting regulations were enacted in December, appeared to drift into uncertainty yet again after the palace announced King Rama X s coronation would take place May 4.

Let me warn you that this is the Kingdom of Thailand where the king is the head of the state. Please show respect. Chulcherm Yugala, a distant relative of King Rama V, also advocated for a delay. The Election Commission should postpone the election to May 19, 2019, after the coronation ceremonies are over. This is the most appropriate action, he wrote online, adding that it s his personal opinion. Deputy PM Wissanu Krea ngam told reporters today that the election must be held by May 9 as the law requires, with no possible exception. He also advised the Election Commission to complete ballot counting by that date to avoid any possible legal dispute. The junta s promises to stage elections have been made and broken repeatedly since the 2014 coup.

Several politicians have weighed in with their concerns, while about 200 protesters sent a more strident message Tuesday evening at the Ratchaprasong Intersection in downtown Bangkok. Facing dissatisfaction with their maneuvering, the government and Election Commission keep pointing fingers at each other over who s responsible.

Future Forward Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit said protesters were giving voice to years of pent up frustration. Various officials have said a delay might be necessary due to His Majesty the King s announcement he will be crowned in early May. Since then, junta leaders and the Election Commission have repeatedly dodged responsibility for setting the date. Deputy PM Wissanu Krea Ngam has said the commission has the sole authority to do so. In return, commission president Ittiporn Boonprakong said yesterday that the body can t do without a signed royal decree that was expected last week. Although no official has said the word delay, a government memo ordering elections officials nationwide to halt preparations was leaked this week and later authenticated by the interior minister.

Speaking Tuesday about his recent trip to Manama to meet Prime Minister Prince Khalifa bin Salam Al Khalifa, Don praised the gulf kingdom for its sensitivity. He said Bahrain looked at the issue from the perspective of the two nation s special relationship and did not want to see Thailand criticized for something it was uninvolved in. Bahrain is aware that Thailand is being pressured and recognizes that this is an important year for Thailand, Don said, in a reference to the coronation of King Rama X set for May 4 to May 6. They don t want the issue to drag on and do not want Thailand to feel burdened. Bahrain is a good friend, and I insist the trip was made not because Thailand was pressured but because Bahrain thinks it is a matter that needs to be resolved. AlAraibi was freed Monday more than two months after his Nov. 27 arrest in Bangkok. Thai immigration police cited an Interpol Red Notice in his detention, though it was later withdrawn after Australia protested that it had been mistakenly issued as AlAraibi is a political refugee there. Bahrain wanted AlAraibi on alleged counts of arson and vandalism and sought his extradition from Thailand. AlAraibi maintains he fled political persecution in his home country and would face it again were he forced to return. He also denies the charges and says he was playing in a televised football match on the day of his alleged crime. After Bahrain s extradition request was withdrawn Monday, the Criminal Court ordered AlAraibi freed after he had spent two and a half months in prison. AlAraibi left Bangkok after midnight early Tuesday morning and arrived in Melbourne later in the day.

Police said the 25 year old tourist fell to his death while riding a zipline in a forest at the popular tourist destination Mae Kam Pong. His safety locks broke, causing him to plunge more than 50 meters into a creek. He died at the scene. Update No Charges Filed Over Zipline Fall That Killed Canadian Police Zipline operator Flight of the Gibbon said it would take full responsibility and compensate the victim s family. Workers at the zipline service said the safety locks broke shortly after the tourist took off from the starting point. Police suspect that the safety equipment could not hold his weight, adding that they found only three cables installed to hold customers, while there would normally be at least eight lines of cables to ensure safety. The operator s website states that people weighing more than 125 kilograms are not allowed to ride. There has been a discrepancy in reports about the tourist s weight. Maj. Gen. Pichate Jiranantasin, provincial police chief, said by phone Saturday evening that the tourist weighed about 180 kilograms, adding that the operator has been charged with fatal negligence for allowing such a heavy person on the ride. A friend of the victim s family, who do not want to be identified, however told Khaosod English via email that the number is incorrect. Some news reports also claimed he weighed about 125 kilograms. Since 2016, Chiang Mai officials promised to improve safety standards of the many adventure tourism sites in the province following a string of serious or fatal accidents including accidents at this very zipline operator.

University students and other citizens expressed their impatience with the EC s inability to declare the credible full tally a full week after the election. Discrepancies in numbers provided by the EC have raised suspicions and it has been unable to provide credible explanations to allay public frustration. The EC has also failed to combat false news and misunderstanding spread over the internet. Every statement it issues on its Facebook page has met only more cynicism. More than 820,000 people have signed a petition at change.org to impeach the seven commissioners. University students across the country defied school and state officials in setting up tables to gather signatures on petitions with a similar message. Demonstrators in Bangkok gathered yesterday on the skywalk above the Victory Monument and around the Ratchaprasong intersection to protest the alleged lack of transparency in the election and the performance of the EC. However, the public disaffection might have no real legal impact, according to rights and legislation watchdog iLaw. The current Constitution rejects public petitions against independent agencies, iLaw said, adding that the complaints should instead be taken to the National Anti Corruption Commission NACC , which could determine whether there was cause to submit the case to court. While the public is seething and wants the EC held accountable for its perceived ineffectiveness and lack of transparency, former commissioner Sodsri doubted that impeachment would be a sound option at this stage. It is possible for the people to bring the case to the NACC, Sodsri said. However, if the NACC takes it up and sends it to the court, the commissioners might have to be suspended from duty. The investigation could take considerable time before the NACC and the court reach their conclusions, she added. The matter might not invalidate the election altogether, the expert said, but the suspension could interrupt endorsement of the final results and delay other post election processes. With growing public pressure on the EC, Sodsri said she was also concerned it might become another political issue. Some parties could demand a fresh election. Others could call for street protests with the aim of justifying another coup. It would be best if the EC came clean about everything, Sodsri said. In constituencies where results are in question, the agency should reopen the ballot boxes and clear all doubts, she suggested.

Thailand is the Asean chair this year and is required to host two summits of regional leaders and several other meetings at the ministerial and senior official levels. Asean diplomats have expressed their worries that the political uncertainty might jeopardise Thailand s leadership of the regional bloc. The first Asean ministerial meeting will take place in the middle of next week in Chiang Mai. The much anticipated Royal Decree on the election, which will allow the Election Commission to fix the poll date, has yet to be issued and Prayut yesterday said he did not know when it would be published in the Royal Gazette. It will be when it will be, Prayut told reporters yesterday after the weekly Cabinet meeting. I haven t said anything about a delay or no delay. Speaking of the upcoming royal coronation, which is said to be the reason for the proposed delay in the election, Prayut said that international friends all wanted to participate in the event. All the countries I have visited, they understand. So, what do you want from me he said, apparently irritated by the criticism and media reports over the possibility of the national poll being postponed. Although in the past couple months the regime had appeared firm about the election and even spoke of holding it on February 24, its recent moves suggest that the process might be put off by a month, to March 24, due to the coronation ceremony of the King in May. Confusion over legal issues have complicated the fixing of the election date. None of the concerned authorities had any answers to the public s demand for an election. Election Commission EC president Ittiporn Boonpracong yesterday rejected reports that the agency preferred March 10 as the day for the casting of ballots. Only after the Royal Decree on the election is published can the EC determine the poll date, he said. We at the EC are well aware of our responsibility. We have to follow the law and give some clarity to the public, Ittiporn said. But I don t want to give out any unconfirmed information. Earlier, it was said that the EC wanted March 10 to be the polling day to ensure that they could finalise the results within 150 days of the electoral laws coming into effect. The Constitution requires that the election process be completed within the 150 day period. But questions arose if the 150 day period covered only the casting of ballots or also the announcement of the election results. There are fears that confusion on this score could lead to the annulment of the election as unconstitutional. Ittiporn yesterday said that the agency was now focused on holding the election within 150 days after the electoral laws come into effect and announcing the results 60 days after the poll. Despite the debate on the 150 period, Ittiporn said the agency had yet to consider bringing the question to the Constitutional Court. In a related development, at least 150 pro poll protesters yesterday gathered around the Ratchaprasong intersection in the heart of Bangkok to show their opposition to any delay of the election. They demanded that the junta be frank about the publication of the Royal Decree and stop intervening in the electoral process, which is the responsibility of the EC. While the government claims the overlapping of the royal coronation ceremony with the election could make the holding of an election in February difficult, the group said the government should be more efficient in its work to ensure that both the coronation and the election could go on according to the planned schedule.",['Prayut Chan'],"['Prayut', 'Ittiporn']",[],"['Asean', 'Asean', 'Asean', 'Election', 'Commission', 'election.', 'Election', 'Commission', 'EC', 'Ittiporn', 'Boonpracong', 'EC', 'EC', 'EC']",[],"['Thailand', 'Thailand', 'King', 'Bangkok']",['Thailand'],"['DESPITE mounting criticism and widespread calls to avoid a further delay of the election, Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha yesterday remained defiant and refused to say whether the poll would be put off, while claiming the international community understood the situation']",[],[],"['DESPITE mounting criticism and widespread calls to avoid a further delay of the election, Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha yesterday remained defiant and refused to say whether the poll would be put off, while claiming the international community understood the situation']","DESPITE mounting criticism and widespread calls to avoid a further delay of the election, Prime Minister Prayut Chan o cha yesterday remained defiant and refused to say whether the poll would be put off, while claiming the international community understood the situation.

Although in the past couple months the regime had appeared firm about the election and even spoke of holding it on February 24, its recent moves suggest that the process might be put off by a month, to March 24, due to the coronation ceremony of the King in May. Confusion over legal issues have complicated the fixing of the election date.
Election Commission EC president Ittiporn Boonpracong yesterday rejected reports that the agency preferred March 10 as the day for the casting of ballots.
Only after the Royal Decree on the election is published can the EC determine the poll date, he said.
Earlier, it was said that the EC wanted March 10 to be the polling day to ensure that they could finalise the results within 150 days of the electoral laws coming into effect.
But questions arose if the 150 day period covered only the casting of ballots or also the announcement of the election results.
Ittiporn yesterday said that the agency was now focused on holding the election within 150 days after the electoral laws come into effect and announcing the results 60 days after the poll.
They demanded that the junta be frank about the publication of the Royal Decree and stop intervening in the electoral process, which is the responsibility of the EC.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,b'1/8/19 0:00',[{'Prayut': 1.0}],"[{'election.': 0.9411764705882353}, {'EC': 1.0}]","['Thailand', 'Thailand', 'Thailand', 'King', 'Bangkok']","[{'Bangkok': (13.7538929, 100.8160803)}, {'Thailand': (14.8971921, 100.83273)}, {'King,Kansas,United States': (38.471212, -99.554671)}]","[(13.7538929, 100.8160803), (14.8971921, 100.83273), (38.471212, -99.554671)]","[{'Bangkok': (13.7538929, 100.8160803)}, {'Thailand': (14.8971921, 100.83273)}]","[(13.7538929, 100.8160803), (14.8971921, 100.83273)]",3,Thailand

Police in Indonesia s easternmost Papua region apologized but also attempted to justify the officers actions by saying the snake was not venomous and that they hadn t resorted to beating the man, who was suspected of theft. Human rights lawyer Veronica Koman said Sunday that the interrogation methods were torture and violated police policies as well as several laws. She said it was only the latest of several reports of police and military using snakes to terrorize Papuan detainees and symptomatic of a culture of racism against indigenous Papuans. Sam Lokon, a member of the West Papua National Committee, which advocates for independence from Indonesia, was put in a cell with a snake and also beaten after being arrested in January, Koman said. Police indicated the incident with the alleged thief happened recently, during a crackdown on petty crime in Jayawijaya district. The spread of the video had forced police into a very rare apology, Koman said, while also criticizing the attempt to provide a justification. The one minute and 20 second video shows the dark brown snake, at least two meters long, wrapped around the handcuffed suspect s neck and waist and an officer pushing its head into the man s face as he becomes increasingly hysterical. Officers appear to be asking how many times he d stolen cellphones. Jayawijaya police chief Tonny Ananda Swadaya said the officers had been disciplined by being given ethics training and moved to other locations. The events are likely to further inflame tensions in the region where an insurgency has simmered since the early 1960s when Indonesia took control of the western half of the island of New Guinea, formerly a Dutch colony. Police and military have carried out a sweeping crackdown on independence supporters after rebel fighters in December killed 19 people working on a construction site for the trans Papua highway. A Polish man who is being held in a Jayawijaya prison while on trial for treason said earlier this week he d been assaulted by police officers visiting the prison as guards looked on.
